One typical, and easily corrected mistake: Don't forget to handle null!

A fundamental mistake: "integrating" into some function with specified
input/output behaviour some special "feature", so that the task at hand
is treated easier -- this violates the fundamental contract between the
client and the programmer, that a function does what it is supposed to do!
You must not spoil functions used by others with "private" issues.
Obviously, public functions are in any case used by others.
However, also private functions, when they have given a specification,
may be used by others, namely by maintenance programmers (inside the
class).

How concat, sum, max, min are implemented, has up to style issues only
one solution: see Functions.java !

The big case distinction in main:

Using "return" helps the reader (and the compiler) to determine when
a case is finished -- otherwise the rest of the program had to be inspected!
I use additionally "else if" here to emphasise this structure.
