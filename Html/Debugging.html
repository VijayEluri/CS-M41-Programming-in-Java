  <h1>Finding bugs in Java programs</h1>


  <h2>Syntax errors</h2>

  <ul>
   <li> The most important rule is to scroll up (in the console window) to
    find the <strong>first</strong> error - most of the time it's easiest to
    ignore all other errors. </li>
   <li> Go to the line of the error; sometimes it is just enough to look at
    this line (closely) to spot the problem. </li>
   <li> Otherwise one needs to understand (partially) the error message;
    besides the line-number also the column-number is helpful. </li>
   <li> An important method to encounter only a small number of syntax errors,
    and that at a known location, is to <strong>compile often</strong>:
    <ol>
     <li> Enter only one line or one <strong>complete</strong> construct at a
      time, and immediately compile the program. </li>
     <li> To start with, it is very important to enter the
      <strong>complete</strong> class scaffolding, i.e.,
      <pre>
class XXX {
}
      </pre>
      If you wouldn't enter immediately the closing brackets, you could check
      for syntax errors only once the program would be completed, and then
      you'll be (likely) overwhelmed with syntax errors. </li>
     <li> Then comes
      <pre>
public static void main(final String[] args) {
}
      </pre>
      inside the class. Again, the closing brackets are needed. </li>
     <li> After each such unit entered, compile the program - if you get a
      syntax error, very likely it is located in the small piece of code you
      just entered. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Runtime errors</h2>

  <h3>Arrays</h3>

  <ul>
   <li> For example the small program
    <pre>
class Test {
  public static void main(final String[] args) {
    int i = 0;
    System.out.println(args[i]);
  }
}
    </pre>
    when run without a parameter, throws the exception
    <pre>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0
        at Test.main(Test.java:4)
    </pre>
    which is quite informative:
    <ol>
     <li> In the function <code>main</code> in class <code>Test</code>, at line
      4 of the file "Test.java", an array-index was not within the allowed
      bounds, and that index is 0. </li>
     <li> Recall that for an array <code>A</code> the allowed indices i are the
      natural numbers 0 <= i < A.length. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Now directly before the critical instruction, print the length of the
    array and the index, to see the error more clearly:
    <pre>
class Test {
  public static void main(final String[] args) {
    int i = 0;
System.err.println(args.length);
System.err.println(i);
    System.out.println(args[i]);
  }
}
    </pre>
    Note that printing happens to standard-error, and that here the
    print-statements are not indented --- this is so that one doesn't forget
    to remove the debugging-statements at the end!
   </li>
   <li> It might also happen (though perhaps not with our small programs),
    that the array hasn't been created, for example
    <pre>
class Test {
  public static void main(final String[] args) {
    int[] A = null;
    A[0] = 0;
  }
}
    </pre>
    creates the runtime error
    <pre>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
        at Test.main(Test.java:4)
    </pre>
    since A is the null-pointer (points to "nothing"). We see that Java's
    compile-time checking is not very clever (or it is very "formal"): The
    program
    <pre>
class Test {
  public static void main(final String[] args) {
    int[] A;
    A[0] = 0;
  }
}
    </pre>
    would have created a compile-time error ("variable A might not have been
    initialized"), while the above <em>equivalent</em> program doesn't create a
    compile-time error. </li>
  </ul>
