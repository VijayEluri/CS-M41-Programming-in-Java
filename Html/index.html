  <h2> General information </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> First week (22/9/2009 - 25/9/2009):
    <ol>
     <li> Lectures 11:30 - 13:30 in the Robert Recorde room. </li>
     <li> Lab sessions from 14:00 - 16:00 in the Linux lab (room 217). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> From 28/9/2009 to 4/12/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Friday, 11-12 the lecture takes place in the Robert Recorde room.
     </li>
     <li> Friday 13-14 we have the lab session (in the Linux lab). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the lab sessions:
    <ol>
     <li> Active participation in all lab session is awarded 10% of the
      overall module marks. </li>
     <li> For each lab sessions tasks are distributed, related to the
      accompanying lecture (from the same day). </li>
     <li> During the lab session, work on these tasks is expected. </li>
     <li> "Active participation" means that during the whole lab session
      reasonable work related to the module is performed, typically related
      to the current tasks, but possibly also related to previous tasks,
      or to other questions or problems (of course, related to the module).
     </li>
     <li> There are no tests (or exams) in the labs. Every student present for
      the full time and doing reasonable work gets acknowledged his/her
      active participation. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Assessment:
    <ol>
     <li> 10% is allocated to active participation in the lab sessions. </li>
     <li> Roughly in week 4 and week 7 two courseworks are handed out,
      each worth 20%. </li>
     <li> The remaining 50% is the January exam. </li>
     <li> The exam is based on what we did in the lectures, the lab sessions,
      and the coursework. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Lab sessions </h2>

  <p>
   Remark: If some answer is already given, then <em>understand</em> why
   this is the correct answer.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> Week 0:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday: The Exercises from Section 1.1 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/11hello/"> here </a> at the
      bottom, Exercises 1 - 5).
     </li>
     <li> Wednesday:
      <ol>
       <li> Enter the five programs from the lecture, run them with all sorts
        of different arguments, understand the outcome. </li>
       <li> Especially try to <em>crash</em> the programs (missing or
        strange inputs, very large or very small numbers, ...). </li>
       <li> You might also have a look at the improved programs. </li>
       <li> After you did this for some time, consider the exercises from
        Section 1.2 (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/12types/"> here </a>
        at the bottom, Exercises 1 - 23).
        <ul>
         <li> Exercises 1.2.1 - 1.2.14 are about understanding expressions.
         </li>
         <li> Write little programs which compute the expressions, possibly
          for all inputs (especially in the case of boolean expressions).
          </li>
          <li> If you wish to write a new program, consider 1.2.14 - 1.2.23.
          </li>
         </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Thursday:
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program which reads two integers and prints them out sorted
        in ascending order. </li>
       <li> Write another program which reads three integers and prints them
        out sorted in ascending order. </li>
       <li> Write a better version of "TenHellos.java" (printing "Hello World!"
        ten times), using a while-loop. </li>
       <li> Consider exercises 1.3.1 - 1.3.7 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>);
        perhaps first considering exercises 1, 3, 4 (perhaps writing a complete
        program), 6 (again perhaps writing programs to testing your answer)
        and 7. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Friday:
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the sum
        1 + 2 + ... + N. </li>
       <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the product
        1 * 2 * ... * N; choose a suitable data type so that some interesting
       computations can be performed! </li>
       <li> Enter the program "Gambler" from the lecture, and play around with
        it a bit. </li>
       <li> Improve the output of "Gambler":
        <ul>
         <li> Print out the inputs, with additional explanations. </li>
         <li> Print out the frequency wins/T (where T is the number of
          trials). </li>
         <li> Print out the probability stake/goal of winning. </li>
         <li> Print out the expected number of steps (stake)*(goal-stake).
         </li>
         <li> Finally determine the average and the maximum number of steps
          it took to finish a trial (that is, the number of steps until cash
          either is 0 or goal), and print it out. </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li> Consider exercises 1.3.8 - 1.3.31 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>). </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 1, Friday, 2/10/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Enter program "Deck" from the lecture, understand it, run it. </li>
     <li> Write another program, which uses only a deck of 32 cards, where
      the ranks do not include 2 up to 6. </li>
     <li> Now combine both programs into one, where via a command-line argument
      it is decided whether 32 or 52 cards are to be used. </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.4.1 - 1.4.5 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.4.35 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 2, Friday, 9/10/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Today we want mainly learn how to use the three libraries
      StdIn.java, StdOut.java, and StdDraw.java. </li>
     <li> Write programs "RandomSeq" for printing out a sequence of N random
      floating-point numbers (to standard output), and "Average" for reading
      floating-point numbers from standard input and computing their average.
      </li>
     <li> Play a bit around with redirecting input and output, and pipe the
      two programs together. </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.5.1 - 1.5.3 from the book:
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program that reads in integers (as many as the user
        enters) from standard input and prints out the maximum and minimum
        values. Before entering the program, make a sketch on paper. </li>
       <li> Modify this program by rejecting non-positive entries, asking the
        user to re-enter the input (until he gets it correct). Before
       entering the program, extend the previous sketch. Hint: a while-loop
       is appropriate for testing the input values.</li>
       <li> Read N from the command line and N floating-point number from
        standard input, and compute their mean value. Create an error message
        if not enough numbers were entered. Compute also the standard
        deviation as the square root of the sum of the squares of the
        differences from these numbers and the average, the whole then divided
        by N-1. Hint: For this computation you could store the numbers in
        an array. </li>
      </ol>
      Always test your programs thoroughly!
     </li>
     <li> Write  program "SinFunction" that plots the function sin(4x)+sin(20x)
      (see the lecture script). </li>
     <li> If you have still time, or as a little home work, consider exercise
      1.5.7 from the book: Read in N from the command-line plus N-1 integers
      from 1 to N from standard input, assuming that these numbers are
      different. Now determine the missing number (from the interval 1 .. N).
      </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 3, Friday, 16/10/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.1 - 2.1.4 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> As additional exercises you can consider 2.1.13, 2.1.14 and 2.1.17.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 4, Friday, 23/10/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> If you didn't finish the exercises from last week, you might
      finish them now. </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.18, 2.1.19 and 2.1.20 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Friday, 30/10/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> This lab session is for <strong>catching up!</strong> </li>
     <li> No new exercises --- please consider the exercises from previous
      weeks you didn't do. </li>
     <li> Functions are very important, so also if you are doing exercises
      from previous weeks not involving functions, do them now with functions.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>

  

  <h2> Coursework </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> First coursework: <strong>Deadline 9/11/2009.</strong> </li>
   <li> A program "Poker.java" has to be written, consisting of the class
    "Poker", and this file has be sent via e-mail to me (just a single file).
   </li>
   <li> This program shall take one command line argument N. </li>
   <li> For N=0 the following should happen:
    <ol>
     <li> A hand of (five) cards is read from standard input, where each
      card comes in the form "Jack of Clubs" etc. (as we had it in the
      example from the lecture). </li>
     <li> Additional spaces (or space symbols like end-of-line symbols or
      tab-symbols) must not matter. </li>
     <li> The program then determines which of the nine standard hand ranks
      <ol>
       <li> Straight flush (a straight and a flush) </li>
       <li> Four of a kind (four equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> Full house (two equal card ranks together with three equal card
       ranks) </li>
       <li> Flush (all cards of same suit) </li>
       <li> Straight (cards in rank order, where the ace can be used as
       the lowest or the highest card rank) </li>
       <li> Three of a kind (three equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> Two pair (two times two equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> One pair (two equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> High card (none of the above). </li>
      </ol>
      applies for the hand, where in case of several possibilities the higher
      rank has to be output. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> For N > 0 the program chooses itself N random hands, counts how often
    each of the above hand ranks occurs, and outputs the relative frequency of
    each rank, the quotients (number of occurrences) / N. </li>
   <li> You need to determine for which N the values are really close to the
    correct probabilities, and in a comment in your program you need to
    show such N and the output produced by your program. </li>
   <li> Very important:
    <ol>
     <li> Your program must compile. </li>
     <li> Your program must run. </li>
     <li> It must produce correct results. </li>
     <li> Try to give good error messages in case some user input is wrong.
     </li>
     <li> Use good variable names. </li>
     <li> Declare variables as local as possible. </li>
     <li> Use many <strong>functions</strong>. </li>
     <li> Specify the meaning of functions and important variables via
      comments. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Hints:
    <ol>
     <li> Strings are not appropriate data types (except for input and output).
     </li>
     <li> Best is to use codes, like 1 .. 52 for the cards, 1 .. 4 for the
      suites, 1 .. 13 for the card ranks, and 1 .. 9 for the hand ranks. </li>
     <li> You can use modular arithmetic to handle these codes somewhat more
      elegantly, but this is not needed. </li>
     <li> Provide functions for extracting the suit-code and the
      card-rank-code from a card-code. </li>
     <li> When reading cards from (standard) input, you read in single strings,
      and then you need to compare the input string <em>objects</em> to
      given strings in order to compute the codes. Use the member function
      "String.equals" for that. </li>
     <li> Thus provide functions which convert strings for card ranks and
      strings for suits to the respective codes. </li>
     <li> Conversely you need functions which convert codes into the strings.
      </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>
