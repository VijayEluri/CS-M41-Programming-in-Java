  <h2> Messages </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> Today, 11/11/2011, first support-lab session (16-18) in the Linux lab.
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h2> General information </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> First week (3/10/2011 - 7/10/2011):
    <ol>
     <li> One lecture Friday 11:00 - 12:00 in the Robert Recorde room. </li>
     <li> One lab session Friday 12:00 - 13:00 in the Linux lab (room 217).
      <ol>
       <li> This is a short session. </li>
       <li> The task is just to get used to the environment (knowing your
        password, etc.). </li>
       <li> Tasks:
        <ul>
         <li> Check that your login works. </li>
         <li> Access the course home page, and store the link. </li>
         <li> Browse the course home page, and get a bit familiar with it.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> From 10/10/2010 to 9/12/2010:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday, 16:00 - 18:00, "support lab" session in the Linux lab
      (room 217). </li>
     <li> Friday, 11:00 - 12:00, lecture in the Robert Recorde room.
     </li>
     <li> Friday 12:00 - 13:00, "exercise lab" session (Linux lab). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the <strong>support lab sessions</strong>:
    <ol>
     <li> In the support lab sessions a mixture of teaching and programming
      practice takes place. </li>
     <li> We might not make use of all support lab sessions. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the <strong>exercise lab sessions</strong>:
    <ol>
     <li> Active participation in all exercise lab session is awarded 10% of
      the overall module marks. </li>
     <li> For each exercise lab sessions tasks are distributed. </li>
     <li> During the exercise lab session, work on these tasks is expected.
     </li>
     <li> "Active participation" means that during the whole lab session
      reasonable work related to the module is performed, typically related
      to the current tasks, but possibly also related to previous tasks,
      or to other questions or problems (of course, related to the module).
     </li>
     <li> There are no tests (or exams) in the labs. Every student present for
      the full time and doing reasonable work gets acknowledged his/her
      active participation. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Assessment:
    <ol>
     <li> 10% is allocated to active participation in the exercise lab
      sessions. </li>
     <li> Roughly in week 4 and week 7 two courseworks are handed out,
      each worth 20%. </li>
     <li> The remaining 50% is the January exam. </li>
     <li> The exam is based on what we did in the lectures, the lab sessions,
      and the coursework. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h2> The textbook </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> This module is based on the book

    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> It is <strong>strongly recommended that you buy this book</strong>
    (for example at the Campus book shop). </li>
   <li> The book's home page is
    <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/home/"> here </a>. </li>

     <strong> The following is the old information for 2010/11, which can
      serve as a first indication. </strong> Will be updated soon.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li> Week 3:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday (19/10/2010):
      <ol>
       <li> We look at the program "IntOps" in detail (
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOps.java">here</a> is
        the code). </li>
       <li> There are many problems with this program, and we try to write a
        "perfect" version of it. </li>
       <li> We learn
        <ol>
         <li> <code>final</code> (for declaring constants) </li>
         <li> <code>if</code> (for conditional execution) </li>
         <li> the <code>length</code>-variable to be used with
          <code>args</code> (finding out how many command-line arguments were
          entered) </li>
         <li> <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code> and <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>
          (to find out the range of int's) </li>
         <li> the <code>System.exit</code> function (early return with
          exit-code) </li>
         <li> conditional expressions (to initialise variables in one go)
         </li>
         <li> <code>try ... catch</code> (error handling via catching
          exceptions). </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOpsP.java">Here</a>
        is the improved version. </li>
       <li> Actually, this improved version is in one respect more advanced
        than what we discussed in the lab --- can you spot the difference?
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Friday (22/10/2010): Section 1.3

       <li> Loops are very important, so please make sure you understand
        this section. </li>
         <li> And understand the <code>Gambler</code>-program in detail! </li>
      </ol>
     </li>

        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/InputOutput"> here </a>
        for the input-output library we will use from now on.
       </li>
       <li> You can either copy the .java-files from this library to the
        directory with your program-files, or you can precompile the library
        (by "javac *"), and then just copy the .class-files. </li>
       <li> Additional material you find
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/15inout/"> here</a>.

   </li>
   <li> Week 6:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday (9/11/2010):
      <ol>
       <li> Completing Section 1.5
        <a href="Slides/15inout-2x2.pdf"> Input and output </a>.
       </li>
       <li> Please enter all programs (still) by hand (no copy-and-paste).
       </li>
       <li> This session completes the part on the basics of programming
        (variables, expressions, basic types, loops, conditions, arrays).
       </li>
       <li> In the remainder of the module we will accelerate the speed;
        programs to be considered in support lab sessions will be larger and
        will be given as files. </li>
       <li> 
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">RandomSeq.java</a>
        is a simple example programs which outputs N (pseudo)random numbers
        to standard output.
       </li>
       <li> 
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">Average.java</a>
        shows how to read an arbitrary stream of numbers from standard
        input and computing their arithmetic mean.
       </li>
       <li> This program is improved over the book version by
        <ul>
         <li> using more expressive code, </li>
         <li> checking for empty inputs, </li>
         <li> handling of input errors, </li>
         <li> and also allowing "arbitrarily" long input sequences (for all
          practical purposes). </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">PlotFilter.java</a> reads
         (all from standard input)
        <ol>
         <li> first four floating-point numbers for min x/y-values and max
          x/y-values, </li>
         <li> and then an arbitrary sequence of points, specified by their
          x,y coordinates (as floating-point numbers), </li>
        </ol>
        drawing each point when read.
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">SinFunction.java</a> plots
         the function sin(4x)+sin(20x) for 0 &lt;= x &lt;= pi.
        <ol>
         <li> Have a look at the error handling, which uses error-code
         constants specified at class-level. </li>
         <li> Note also that the constants "4" and "20" are not hard-coded.
         </li>
         <li> The command-line argument N is the number of points except the
          first point, used to plot the function by connecting them. </li>
         <li> If N is not large enough, then the output can be very misleading.
         </li>

         <li> For that to work, the name of the class had to be changed,

  </p>

  <ul>
   <li> Week 2 (15/10/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> The program "UseArgument.java" from the book is needed again ---
      rewrite it <strong>from scratch</strong>, not using notes!
      <ol>
       <li> Recall that it is called with, e.g.,
        <pre>
> java UseArgument XYZ
        </pre>
  and it outputs
  <pre>
Hi, XYZ. How are you?
        </pre>
       </li>
       <li> It's really important that you get the syntax into your fingers.
       </li>
       <li> If you get stuck, then have a <em>tiny</em> little glimpse into
        the book, just to help you to continue. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Do the Exercises from Section 1.1 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/11hello/"> here </a> at the
      bottom, Exercises 1 - 5).
     </li>
     <li> Enter the program
      <pre>
public class LeftAssociative {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    final int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    final int b = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
    System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + a + b); // not what is meant
    System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + (a + b));
    System.out.println(a + b + " + " + "13" + " = " + (a + b + 13)); // understand this
  }
}
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> Play around with it, and understand what it is doing. </li>
     <li> The key is to understand that we have variables of two types,
      <code>int</code> and <code>String</code>, and that automatic conversions
      are performed from <code>int</code> to <code>String</code> if needed.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 3 (22/10/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Enter the three programs from the lecture (Flip, PowersOfTwo, Sqrt),
      run them with all sorts of different arguments, understand the
      outcome. </li>
     <li> Especially try to <em>crash</em> the programs (missing or
      strange inputs, very large or very small numbers, ...). </li>
     <li> After you did this for some time, consider the exercises from
      Section 1.2 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/12types/"> here </a>
      at the bottom, Exercises 1 - 23).
      <ul>
       <li> Exercises 1.2.1 - 1.2.14 are about understanding expressions.
       </li>
       <li> Write little programs which compute the expressions, possibly
        for all inputs (especially in the case of boolean expressions).
       </li>
       <li> If you wish to write a new program, consider 1.2.14 - 1.2.23.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 4 (29/10/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program which reads two integers and prints them out sorted
      in ascending order. </li>
     <li> Write another program which reads three integers and prints them
      out sorted in ascending order. </li>
     <li> Write better versions of "TenHellos.java" (printing "Hello World!"
      ten times), using first a while-loop and then a for-loop. Which
      is better? </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.3.1 - 1.3.7 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>);
      perhaps first considering exercises 1, 3, 4 (perhaps writing a complete
      program), 6 (again perhaps writing programs to testing your answer)
      and 7. </li>
    </ol>
    See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Week00_Thursday"> here </a>
    for solutions. Additional exercises:
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the sum
      1 + 2 + ... + N. </li>
     <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the product
      1 * 2 * ... * N; choose a suitable data type so that some interesting
      computations can be performed! </li>
     <li> Enter the program "Gambler" from the lecture, and play around with
      it a bit. </li>
     <li> Improve the output of "Gambler":
      <ul>
       <li> Print out the inputs, with additional explanations. </li>
       <li> Print out the frequency wins/T (where T is the number of
        trials). </li>
       <li> Print out the probability stake/goal of winning. </li>
       <li> Print out the expected number of steps (stake)*(goal-stake).
       </li>
       <li> Finally determine the average and the maximum number of steps
        it took to finish a trial (that is, the number of steps until cash
        either is 0 or goal), and print it out. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.3.8 - 1.3.31 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>). </li>
    </ol>
    See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Week00_Friday"> here </a>
    for solutions.
   </li>
   <li> Week 5 (5/11/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Enter program "Deck" from the lecture, understand it, run it. </li>
     <li> Write another program, which uses only a deck of 32 cards, where
      the ranks do not include 2 up to 6. </li>
     <li> Now combine both programs into one, where via a command-line argument
      it is decided whether 32 or 52 cards are to be used. </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.4.1 - 1.4.5 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.4.35 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 6 (12/11/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.5.1 - 1.5.3 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/15inout/"> here</a>):
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program that reads in integers (as many as the user
        enters) from standard input and prints out the maximum and minimum
        values. Before entering the program, make a sketch on paper. </li>
       <li> Modify this program by rejecting non-positive entries, asking the
        user to re-enter the input (until he gets it correct). Before
       entering the program, extend the previous sketch. Hint: a while-loop
       is appropriate for testing the input values.</li>
       <li> Read N from the command-line and N floating-point number from
        standard input, and compute their mean value. Create an error message
        if not enough numbers were entered. Compute also the standard
        deviation as the square root of the sum of the squares of the
        differences from these numbers and the average, the whole then divided
        by N-1. Hint: For this computation you could store the numbers in
        an array. </li>
      </ol>
      Always test your programs thoroughly!
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.5.7 from the book: Read in N from the
      command-line plus N-1 integers from 1 to N from standard input, assuming
      that these numbers are different. Now determine the missing number (from
      the interval 1 .. N). </li>
     <li> As an additional exercise, improve
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">PlotFilter.java</a>
      by not asking for the minimum x/y values, but computing them from
      the input (so the first four special doubles from standard input are not
      needed anymore). Test with
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">USA.txt</a>, where you
      removed the first four numbers.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 7 (19/11/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.1 - 2.1.4 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> As additional exercises you can consider 2.1.13, 2.1.14 and 2.1.17.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 8 (26/11/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> If you didn't finish the exercises from last week, then please
      finish them now (we are still on functions). </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.5, 2.1.12, 2.1.18, 2.1.19 and 2.1.20
      from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> For exercise 2.1.18, if for example the input is the array
      (1,3,7), then the output should be (0,3/7,1). And if the
      input is (-10,-4,-1), then the output should be (0,6/9,1).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 9 (3/12/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Use the data types "Color" and "Picture" from the lecture (see
      above). </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.2 from the book: Write a program that takes from the
     command-line three integers from 0 to 255 (representing red, green
     and blue), and then creates and shows a 256-by-256 picture of that
     colour. </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.3 from the book: Modify program "AlbersSquares" to take
      nine command-line arguments, representing now three colours, and then
      draw the 3*2=6 squares showing all the Albers squares with the large
      square in each colour and the small square in each different colour.
     </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.6 from the book: Write a program that takes the name of
     a picture file as a command-line input, and creates three images, one
     that contains only the red components, one for green, and one for blue.
     </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.4 from the book:
      <ul>
       <li> Write a program that takes the name of a grayscale picture-file
        as a command-line argument, and plots a histogram of the frequency
        of occurrences of each of the 256 grayscale intensities. </li>
       <li> Use the library "StdStats" from Section 2.2 (provided
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Libraries"> here </a>). </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Finally we practise using static data members ("static instance
      variables"). Write a class <code>StringExample</code>:
      <ul>
        <li> Containing (static) constants <code>size_a</code> of
        value 4 and array <code>a</code> containing the four strings "AB",
        "XYZ", "EFG", "1234". </li>
        <li> We also have <code>size_b</code> of value 3, and array
         <code>b</code> containing the three strings "M1", "T3", "y6". </li>
       <li> Furthermore we have a static function <code>check_a</code> which
        takes one string argument x, and returns integers from 0 to 3 if the
        string x occurs in array <code>a</code> with that index, while
        otherwise -1 is returned. </li>
       <li> And in the same vein we have <code>check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> Both functions must use a loop for checking the membership in the
        respective array. </li>
       <li> The main programs reads pairs of strings from standard input (as
        long as standard input has not been closed), and prints out the results
        of <code>check_a, check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> For example "EFG T3" results in "2 1", and "X y6" results in
        "-1 2". </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/StringExample.java">
       the solution </a>.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 10 (10/12/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Creating and using a trivial class:
      <ul>
       <li> Write a class <code>Trivial</code>, which stores two integers (via
        the constructor), and as member functions ("methods") allows to
        compute their sum and to translate the object into a string. </li>
       <li> Write then a program which reads four integers from the
        command-line, creates two objects of type <code>Trivial</code>
        accordingly, and outputs their sums and the objects themselves. </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Trivial.java">
       the Trivial-solution </a>, and here is the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Client.java"> Client </a>.
     </li>
      <li> Study <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Libraries/Turtle.java">
       Turtle.java </a> and the application
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/Spiral.java">Spiral.java </a>;
      play a bit around with it, and write your own clients of class Turtle,
      creating some simple turtle-graphics. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 11 (17/12/2010): Exercises related to parsing strings
    <ol>
     <li> Read a string from the command-line and determine how many
      space-separated parts it has.
      <ul>
       <li> Call the class "CountParts", printing out how many parts there
       are. </li>
       <li> In order to input a string containing spaces, you need to use
        single quotation marks, e.g.
        <pre>
> java CountParts 'hhg   j bbnbh bvc c'
5
        </pre>
       </li>
       <li> This task is very easy using the split-method of the String-class;
        see Section 3.1 of the book (also available
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/31datatype/"> here </a>).
        </li>
       <li> Examples for the split-functions are
        <a href="http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0438.html"> there
         </a>.
       </li>
       <li> Play around with various input (only spaces, leading spaces,
        trailing spaces, ...), to better understand the behaviour. </li>
       <li> Here is a
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/CountParts.java">
         solution </a>
        which also shows the parts with their indices.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Modify the solution of the previous part, where now the string is
      split at the symbol "@".
      <ul>
       <li> Again, play around with it (what happens when spaces are used?).
       </li>
       <li> Here is a
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/SplitCharacter.java">
         solution </a>
        which again shows the parts with their indices.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Parse a string, where you extract all digits from it, adding them
      up, returning their sum and the original string without these digits:
      <ul>
       <li> For example
        <pre>
> java Crossfoot 'dg08 ha ns82g40h1 '
23
"dg ha nsgh "
        </pre>
       </li>
       <li> To detect whether a character is a digit, use that characters
        are treated as integers, and thus can be compared by "&lt;" etc., and
        can be added/subtracted. </li>
       <li> Here is a
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/Crossfoot.java">
         solution </a>.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
    All these techniques you've already seen in the <code>Board</code> class.

   <li> Week 5, Friday, 6/11/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Counting random events:
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program (class) "RandomNumbers" which takes two
        command-line arguments M and N. </li>
       <li> The program then creates N many random integers in the interval
        [1, M], counts how often each of these integers occurs, and then
        prints out the relative frequency for each of these M numbers (that is,
        the quotient "occurrences / N"). </li>
       <li> Your program should work for large N, and thus should not store
        the N random numbers computed. </li>
       <li> For the creation of the random integer write a function
        <code>random(M)</code>, which takes M as parameter, and returns a
        random integer from 1 to M. </li>
       <li> Hint: you need to use an integer-array of size M for performing
        the counting. </li>
      </ol>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/RandomNumbers.java">

   <li> Week 6+7, Friday 13/11/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Libraries:
      <ol>
       <li> Implement the library class StdStats with (just) the static
        functions "min", "max" and "mean". </li>
       <li> Write a program "Stats" which is called with floating point
        numbers as command-line parameters, and which computes their
        minimum, maximum and average, using your library StdStats. </li>
       <li> For example, "Stats 4 5.2" would yield min=4, max=5.2,
        mean=4.6. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Recursion:
      <ol>
       <li> Enter the program "Htree" from the lecture. </li>
       <li> Write a modified program "Htree2", which asks for confirmation
        before continuing drawing parts of the tree. </li>
       <li> Also print out appropriate messages, so that you can follow in
        detail the recursion. </li>
       <li> Run the program for inputs up to 4, and make sure you understand
        what's going on! </li>

   </li>
   <li> Week 9, Friday, 27/11/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Creating and using a trivial class:
      <ul>
       <li> Write a class <code>Trivial</code>, which stores two integers (via
        the constructor), and as member functions ("methods") allows to
        compute their sum and to translate the object into a string. </li>
       <li> Write then a program which reads four integers from the
        command-line, creates two objects of type <code>Trivial</code>
        accordingly, and outputs their sums and the objects themselves. </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Trivial.java">
       the Trivial-solution </a>, and here is the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Client.java"> Client </a>.
     </li>
     <li> Study "Charge.java" and "Potential.java", understand how it works,
      and play a bit around (using for example "charges.txt" as input). </li>
     <li> Study "Turtle.java" and the application "Spiral.java"; again, play
      a bit around with it, and write your own clients of class Turtle,
      creating some simple turtle-graphics. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 10, Friday, 4/12/2009: Understanding the (new) Poker
    class-collection:
    <ol>
     <li> Add to the Card-class a test-function (that is, a "main"-function)
      which creates a couple of cards using the two constructors and
      prints them out. </li>
     <li> Here is a possible
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Card.java">
       solution </a>. </li>
     <li> Extending the analysis capabilities:
      <ul>
       <li> Copy Poker.java to PokerExtended.java (and, of course, update
        the class-name accordingly). </li>
       <li> Now for the case N=0 (where an input-hand is to be analysed),
        add code to show for the 1+5+10=16 exchange possibilities what is
        the best and the worst case which could arise. </li>
       <li> Hint: You just need to apply the given capabilities. </li>
       <li> Evaluation is done by class "Evaluation" (for no big surprise).
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Here is the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/PokerExtended.java">
       extended version </a>. </li>
     <li> Note that this program compiles, but it cannot run successfully
      until you implement the missing functionality. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 11, Friday, 4/12/2009: Using and changing some data type.
    <ul>
     <li> Consider Storage.java from the Poker class-collection (available
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Storage.java">
       here </a>).
     </li>
     <li> First you need to understand the API; so try to understand
      the public members of this class.
     </li>
     <li> Some examples for using this class are already given in the
      test function.
     </li>
     <li> Write a client program which takes N from the command-line,
      stores the products i*j for 1 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt;= N in a Storage-object,
      and outputs the Storage-object.
     </li>
     <li> Now change the implementation (only(!) - not the interface!),
      by just using a two-dimensional array (instead of the one-dimensional
      array as we have it now). </li>
     <li> For that you just need to change the implementations of the
      constructor and of the get/set-functions, and, of course, the definition
      of the instance-variable "results". </li>
     <li> The function "index" is no longer needed. </li>
     <li> The main-function as well as your client must work as before,
      without any need for changing the code, and without changes in the
      observable behaviour.
     </li>
     <li> Recall that a two-dimensional integer array is declared via, e.g.,
      <code>int[][] a;</code>, initialised via, e.g., <code>a = new int[3][4];
      </code>, and used by, e.g., <code>a[2][3] = 77</code>.
     </li>
     <li> Remark on this alternative implementation: It uses more memory,
      but access is quicker, since no index-computations are necessary.
      This is a typical situation, using different implementations for
      trading time versus space.
     </li>
     <li> Since we cannot use inheritance yet, usage of the two implementations
      is a bit clumsy, since we need to have two files "Storage.java"
      somewhere (containing the two implementations), and then to copy one or
      the other into the directory with our application. </li>
     <li> Inheritance allows one to define one "interface class" "Storage",
      which is abstract, and then to define various classes implementing
      this interface, like "StorageFast" and "StorageSmall".
     </li>
     <li> Final remark: Of course, for coursework II only the original files
      are to be used (though it will also work with the alternative
      implementation, of course).
     </li>
    </ul>
    Here is the <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week11"> solution </a>
    (see the sub-directories for old and new versions of Storage.java).
    Altogether 4 programs can be compiled and run:
    <ol>
     <li> The two Storage-programs ("New" and "Old", each with its
      test-program). </li>
     <li> The two versions of the Client-program, using the two versions of
      the Storage-class. </li>
    </ol>
    See the files for how to compile and run these four programs.
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Coursework </h2>

<!--
  <h3> First coursework: Random permutations </h3>

  <ul>
   <li> This coursework is paper-based, to be handed in as ordinary coursework
    via the coursework box. </li>
   <li> Don't forget to sign and attach the coursework sheet. </li>
   <li> Also state clearly the module name, your name and your student
    number. </li>
   <li> Deadline is Monday, 15/11/2010, 16:00. </li>
   <li> You are expected to have tested your code (compiled it and run it).
   </li>
   <li> Syntax errors will result in deductions. </li>
   <li> Use only the Java constructions presented in the lectures. </li>
   <li> Anything else will result in a deduction of 50 percent! (The same will
    hold for the second coursework.) </li>
   <li> This is to make sure that you really concentrate on the essentials,
    and don't copy-and-paste code (which usually contains a lot of noise).
   </li>
   <li> In total you can get 100 marks for this exercise. There are three
   parts:
    <ol>
     <li> Rewrite the program <code>Shuffle</code> from the lecture, now using
      your own (good!) variable names, and making constants <code>final</code>.
      <ul>
       <li> Another change is that no cards are shuffled, but just numbers
        from 1 to N, where N is to be read from the command line. </li>
       <li> So the output of the program is a random permutation of the
        sequence 1, ..., N. </li>
       <li> Try in general to make this little program as nice as possible.
       </li>
       <li> Explain also in your own words how it works. </li>
       <li> This exercise is worth <strong>20%</strong>. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Run computational experiments to check that your shuffling code
      works as advertised.
      <ul>
       <li> Write a program <code>ShuffleTest</code> that takes command-line
        arguments M and N, does N shuffles of an array of size M that is
        initialised with a[i] = i before each shuffle, and prints an M-by-M
        table such that row i gives the number of times i wound up in position
        j for all j. </li>
       <li> All entries in the array should be close to N/M (if your shuffling
        works). </li>
       <li> Explain your program. </li>
       <li> This exercise is worth <strong>50%</strong>. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Bad shuffling.
      <ul>
       <li> Suppose that you choose a random integer between 0 and N-1 in our
        shuffling code instead of one between i and N-1. </li>
       <li> Show that the resulting order is not equally likely to be one of
        the N! possibilities. </li>
       <li> Use Run <code>ShuffleTest</code> for this version, with decent
        values of N and M (so that it takes some time, and the statistical
        quality is high). </li>
       <li> Document your findings, and explain why this form of shuffling
        is bad. </li>
       <li> This exercise is worth <strong>30%</strong>. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h4> Solution </h4>

  <ul>
   <li> The three programs are
    <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201011/One/Shuffle.java"> Shuffle </a>,
    <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201011/One/ShuffleTest.java"> ShuffleTest </a>,
    <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201011/One/BadShuffleTest.java"> BadShuffleTest </a>.
   </li>
   <li> Pay attention to the following:
    <ol>
     <li> Good code handles all user-errors! </li>
     <li> Use <code>++x</code> instead of <code>x++</code>, if the latter is
      not really needed. </li>
     <li> Use <code>final</code> for every possible declaration. </li>
     <li> Indent your code! </li>
     <li> Use good names (never, of course, "my..."). </li>
     <li> If there is a choice between indices "0, ..., n-1" and
      "1, ..., n", then typically (at least for the C-family of languages,
      which includes Java) the 0-based indices are more appropriate. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> A typical output is:

   <li>
    To show you an alternative for compiling and running Java, here compilation

  <h3> Second coursework: Chess </h3>

  <p>
   This coursework is about reading chess positions and move sequences,
   and checking them.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> Formalities:
    <ol>
     <li> Deadline is Monday, 20/12/2010. </li>
     <li> Submission via e-mail. </li>
     <li> The code must be written in all parts solely by you (otherwise zero
      marks are the result, potentially followed by disciplinary actions).
     </li>
     <li> Submission format:
      <ul>
       <li> This time you need also to add code to a couple of files. </li>
       <li> Send me an archive including all your files, where the name of
        the archive is "StudNumber_Coursework_2.ext" (spelled exactly like
        that, but, of course, with your student number filled in, and with
        "ext" your archive-extension). </li>
       <li> That archive contains a directory(!) with name "StudNumber"
        (nothing else), where inside one finds the .java-files, plus
        one additional file "Comments.txt", where you state your name
        and student numbers, followed by any explanations and comments.
       </li>
       <li> No other files shall be placed in that directory. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> We will run your code, and so it must exactly comply with the
      specifications. </li>
     <li> Any deviation from the specifications (including all names!) will
      result in a deduction of 10%. </li>
     <li> Use only the Java constructions presented in the lectures. </li>
     <li> Anything else will result in a deduction of 50 percent! </li>
     <li> This is to make sure that you really concentrate on the essentials,
      and don't copy-and-paste code (which usually contains a lot of noise).
     </li>
     <li> Altogether there will be 180 marks for this coursework, capped at
      100 (in this way by doing more work you can get higher marks). </li>
     <li> However, marks from 110-130 will be taken into account for your
      first coursework (so you gain gain 20 marks; again altogether capped at
      100). </li>
     <li> So, for example, of you reach 150 marks, then coursework II will get
      100 marks, while to coursework I 20 marks are added. And if you gain 120
      marks, then that means 100 marks for coursework II, while 10 marks are
      added to coursework I. </li>
     <li> Reminder: As usual with electronic submission, your submission of
      coursework implicitly contains your signature under the following
      standard phrase from the Coursework Submission Form:
      <p>
       <cite> I am aware of the University policy on unfair practice and I
        certify that this coursework is the result of my own independent work
        except where otherwise stated, and that all other sources are
        explicitly acknowledged. </cite>
      </p>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Specification of the tasks:
    <ol>
     <li> The (final) task is to write a program <code>Chess</code> which
      reads two files, one containing the position, one containing a sequence
      of moves, and then to play this game, checking everything for
      correctness.
      <ol>
       <li> More precisely, a program call has the form
        <pre>
> Chess move_sequence.pgn initial_position.fen

resp.

> java Chess move_sequence.pgn initial_position.fen
        </pre>
        specifying the sequence of moves in PGN notation and the initial
        position in FEN notation (see below). </li>
       <li> If the initial position is not given, then the standard starting
        position is used. </li>
       <li> The program first checks the correctness of the initial position.
       </li>
       <li> If there is no error, then it shows the sequence of moves, but
        checking for errors, and stopping as soon as an illegal move occurs.
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> The details will not be shown all at once, but gradually: This is
      an attempt to make you start working on the coursework by Friday,
      3/12/2010, and gradually making progress. (And we also want to avoid
      that the exercise lab-classes are misused for doing coursework.) </li>
     <li> I guess you know it is very bad management to postpone (important!)
      tasks until the last minute &mdash; only bad quality will arise in this
      way (and remember, a coursework is worth 20% of the whole module). </li>
     <li> A key requirement for this coursework is that you create many
      functions (static and also non-static methods). </li>
     <li> Also some classes will be given to you, to make the task easier, and
      to practice using data types. </li>
     <li> If you can solve the above task of the program Chess
      completely on your own (using only the Java constructions from the
      lectures, of course), you don't need to follow the help given. However
      the task is made much easier by using the given templates. </li>
     <li> The task is subdivided into four classes:
      <ol>
       <li> Class <code>Board</code> handles the board, and reading a position
        in FEN. Worth <strong>80 marks</strong>. </li>
       <li> Class <code>Moves</code> checks the available moves.
       Worth <strong>50 marks</strong>. </li>
       <li> Class <code>Game</code> handles a whole game, and reading a
        sequence of moves in PGN.
        Worth <strong>40 marks</strong>. </li>
       <li> Finally class <code>Chess</code> just integrates these three
        classes into one application.
       Worth <strong>10 marks</strong>. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> <strong>First task</strong>: get to know the basic notions.
      <ul>
       <li> First you need to know the (basic) chess rules:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess"> here </a> is a nice
        account (only sections 1 and 2 are relevant for this exercise). </li>
       <li> A position will be given in "Forsyth-Edwards Notation", about which
        you can read
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation">
         here
        </a>.
       </li>
       <li> A sequence of moves is specified in "PGN Notation", explained
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation"> here
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      Think about how to parse this information.
     </li>
     <li> <strong>Second task</strong>: create the board.
      <ul>
       <li> The class
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201011/Two/Board.java"> Board </a>
        should be completed. </li>
       <li> The functions (methods) marked by "XXX" should be
        completed. </li>
       <li> The <code>assert</code> statements show you what you can assume
        (that is, you don't have to check it (and actually you must not
        check it)). </li>
       <li> An outline of the second class to be created,
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201011/Two/Moves.java"> Moves,
        </a>
        is also available, needed to understand the setting, and to compile
        the code. </li>
       <li> Three functions on castling should be completed (with a given
        role model). </li>
       <li> Then two functions on performing normal moves should be completed.
        (Again, no checking of correctness is involved &mdash; this is assumed.)
       </li>
       <li> More substantial is <code>validFEN</code>, which checks a string
        for complying with the FEN syntax. </li>
       <li> The main function is <code>fromFEN</code>, which assumes a valid
        FEN string, and enters it into the board. </li>
       <li> Finally, <code>toFEN</code> translates the given board into a
        FEN string. </li>
       <li> The main program here only serves for "poor man's unit-testing".
       </li>
       <li> It is very important that you spend some time <strong>reading the
         given code</strong>. </li>
       <li> For string handling, you can use (exactly) the methods of the
        <code>String</code> class as discussed in Section 3.1 of the book
        (pages 338 - 343). </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> <strong>Third task</strong>: check the moves.
      <ul>
       <li> The class
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201011/Two/Moves.java"> Moves </a>
        should be completed. </li>
       <li> As usual, the starting point is to understand the architecture.
       </li>
       <li> The functions (methods) marked by "XXX" should be
        completed. </li>
       <li> The first block of functions to be completed is concerned with
        checking directly the rules: how the figures move, and that there are
        no pieces in the way. </li>
       <li> Then we have special functions for castling. </li>
       <li> Finally we have the functions checking whether a field is under
        attack. As already given, these functions are important for
        implementing the rule that after a move the own king must not be under
        attack. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> <strong>Fourth task</strong>: performing a sequence of moves.
      <ul>
       <li> The class
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201011/Two/Game.java"> Game </a>
        should be completed. </li>
       <li> This is about constructing a Game-object from a move-sequence
        and/or a starting position, and checking the moves. </li>
       <li> As discussed, from <code>Board</code> to <code>Moves</code> to
        <code>Game</code> there is a development, asking more and more design
        from you. </li>
       <li> So for <code>Game</code> only relatively late helping code will be
        shown, so that you get rolling in case you have problems with the
        design. </li>
       <li> Of course, even if you have your own design, likely it is
        advantageous to compare your solution with the structure which will
        be given later, and to update it accordingly. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>
