  <h1>CS-M41 Programming in Java 2010/11</h1>
  
  
  <h2> Messages </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> You will get the marks for coursework I Monday, 29/11/2010,
    per e-mail. </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h2> General information </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> First week (4/10/2010 - 8/10/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> One lecture Friday 11:00 - 12:00 in the Robert Recorde room. </li>
     <li> One lab session Friday 13:00 - 14:00 in the Linux lab (room 217).
      The task is just to get used to the environment (knowing your password,
      etc.). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> From 11/10/2010 to 10/12/2010:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday, 14:00 - 16:00, support lab session in the Linux lab
      (room 217). </li>
     <li> Friday, 11:00 - 12:00, lecture in the Robert Recorde room.
     </li>
     <li> Friday 12:00 - 13:00, exercise lab session (Linux lab). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the support lab sessions:
    <ol>
     <li> In the support lab sessions a mixture of teaching and programming
      practice takes place. </li>
     <li> We will not make use of all support lab sessions. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the exercise lab sessions:
    <ol>
     <li> Active participation in all exercise lab session is awarded 10% of
      the overall module marks. </li>
     <li> For each exercise lab sessions tasks are distributed. </li>
     <li> During the exercise lab session, work on these tasks is expected.
     </li>
     <li> "Active participation" means that during the whole lab session
      reasonable work related to the module is performed, typically related
      to the current tasks, but possibly also related to previous tasks,
      or to other questions or problems (of course, related to the module).
     </li>
     <li> There are no tests (or exams) in the labs. Every student present for
      the full time and doing reasonable work gets acknowledged his/her
      active participation. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Assessment:
    <ol>
     <li> 10% is allocated to active participation in the exercise lab
      sessions. </li>
     <li> Roughly in week 4 and week 7 two courseworks are handed out,
      each worth 20%. </li>
     <li> The remaining 50% is the January exam. </li>
     <li> The exam is based on what we did in the lectures, the lab sessions,
      and the coursework. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h2> The textbook </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> This module is based on the book "Introduction to Programming in Java",
    from Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, Addison-Wesley 2007
    (ISBN-13 978-0-321-49805-2). </li>
   <li> It is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that you buy this book
    (for example at the Campus book shop). </li>
   <li> The book's home page is
    <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/home/"> here </a>. </li>
   <li> Additional to the book, at this web page a lot of useful information
    is available. </li>

    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday (12/10/2010): 
      <ol>
       <li> We write 3 programs together.
        <ol>
         <li> Empty program:
          <code>
class Empty {
  public static void main(String[] args) {}
}
          </code>
         </li>
         <li> Hello-World:
          <pre>
class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}
          </pre>
         </li>
         <li> Hello-World with three further names:
          <pre>
class UseArgument {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("Hello, ");
    System.out.print(args[0]);
    System.out.print(", ");
    System.out.print(args[1]);
    System.out.print(", ");

   <li> Week 3:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday (19/10/2010):
      <ol>
       <li> We look at the program "IntOps" in detail (
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOps.java">here</a> is
        the code). </li>
       <li> There are many problems with this program, and we try to write a
        "perfect" version of it. </li>
       <li> We learn
        <ol>
         <li> <code>final</code> (for declaring constants) </li>
         <li> <code>if</code> (for conditional execution) </li>
         <li> the <code>length</code>-variable to be used with
          <code>args</code> (finding out how many command-line arguments were
          entered) </li>
         <li> <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code> and <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>
          (to find out the range of int's) </li>
         <li> the <code>System.exit</code> function (early return with
          exit-code) </li>
         <li> conditional expressions (to initialise variables in one go)
         </li>
         <li> <code>try ... catch</code> (error handling via catching
          exceptions). </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOpsP.java">Here</a>
        is the improved version. </li>
       <li> Actually, this improved version is in one respect more advanced
        than what we discussed in the lab --- can you spot the difference?
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Friday (22/10/2010): Section 1.3

       </li>
       <li> You can either copy the .java-files from this library to the
        directory with your program-files, or you can precompile the library
        (by "javac *"), and then just copy the .class-files. </li>
       <li> Additional material you find
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/15inout/"> here</a>.

   </li>
   <li> Week 6:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday (9/11/2010):
      <ol>
       <li> Completing Section 1.5
        <a href="Slides/15inout-2x2.pdf"> Input and output </a>.
       </li>
       <li> Please enter all programs (still) by hand (no copy-and-paste).
       </li>
       <li> This session completes the part on the basics of programming
        (variables, expressions, basic types, loops, conditions, arrays).
       </li>
       <li> In the remainder of the module we will accelerate the speed;
        programs to be considered in support lab sessions will be larger and
        will be given as files. </li>
       <li> 
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">RandomSeq.java</a>
        is a simple example programs which outputs N (pseudo)random numbers
        to standard output.
       </li>
       <li> 
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">Average.java</a>
        shows how to read an arbitrary stream of numbers from standard
        input and computing their arithmetic mean.
       </li>
       <li> This program is improved over the book version by
        <ul>
         <li> using more expressive code, </li>
         <li> checking for empty inputs, </li>
         <li> handling of input errors, </li>
         <li> and also allowing "arbitrarily" long input sequences (for all
          practical purposes). </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">PlotFilter.java</a> reads
         (all from standard input)
        <ol>
         <li> first four floating-point numbers for min x/y-values and max
          x/y-values, </li>
         <li> and then an arbitrary sequence of points, specified by their
          x,y coordinates (as floating-point numbers), </li>
        </ol>
        drawing each point when read.
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">SinFunction.java</a> plots
         the function sin(4x)+sin(20x) for 0 &lt;= x &lt;= pi.
        <ol>
         <li> Have a look at the error handling, which uses error-code
         constants specified at class-level. </li>
         <li> Note also that the constants "4" and "20" are not hard-coded.
         </li>
         <li> The command-line argument N is the number of points except the
          first point, used to plot the function by connecting them. </li>
         <li> If N is not large enough, then the output can be very misleading.
         </li>

   Remark: If some answer is already given, then <em>understand</em> why
   this is the correct answer.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li> Week 2 (15/10/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> The program "UseArgument.java" from the book is needed again ---
      rewrite it <strong>from scratch</strong>, not using notes!
      <ol>
       <li> Recall that it is called with, e.g.,
        <pre>
> java UseArgument XYZ
        </pre>
  and it outputs
  <pre>
Hi, XYZ. How are you?
        </pre>
       </li>
       <li> It's really important that you get the syntax into your fingers.
       </li>
       <li> If you get stuck, then have a <em>tiny</em> little glimpse into
        the book, just to help you to continue. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Do the Exercises from Section 1.1 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/11hello/"> here </a> at the
      bottom, Exercises 1 - 5).
     </li>
     <li> Enter the program
      <pre>
public class LeftAssociative {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    final int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    final int b = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
    System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + a + b); // not what is meant
    System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + (a + b));
    System.out.println(a + b + " + " + "13" + " = " + (a + b + 13)); // understand this
  }
}
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> Play around with it, and understand what it is doing. </li>
     <li> The key is to understand that we have variables of two types,
      <code>int</code> and <code>String</code>, and that automatic conversions
      are performed from <code>int</code> to <code>String</code> if needed.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 3 (22/10/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Enter the three programs from the lecture (Flip, PowersOfTwo, Sqrt),
      run them with all sorts of different arguments, understand the
      outcome. </li>
     <li> Especially try to <em>crash</em> the programs (missing or
      strange inputs, very large or very small numbers, ...). </li>
     <li> After you did this for some time, consider the exercises from
      Section 1.2 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/12types/"> here </a>
      at the bottom, Exercises 1 - 23).
      <ul>
       <li> Exercises 1.2.1 - 1.2.14 are about understanding expressions.
       </li>
       <li> Write little programs which compute the expressions, possibly
        for all inputs (especially in the case of boolean expressions).
       </li>
       <li> If you wish to write a new program, consider 1.2.14 - 1.2.23.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 4 (29/10/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program which reads two integers and prints them out sorted
      in ascending order. </li>
     <li> Write another program which reads three integers and prints them
      out sorted in ascending order. </li>
     <li> Write better versions of "TenHellos.java" (printing "Hello World!"
      ten times), using first a while-loop and then a for-loop. Which
      is better? </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.3.1 - 1.3.7 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>);
      perhaps first considering exercises 1, 3, 4 (perhaps writing a complete
      program), 6 (again perhaps writing programs to testing your answer)
      and 7. </li>
    </ol>
    See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Week00_Thursday"> here </a>
    for solutions. Additional exercises:
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the sum
      1 + 2 + ... + N. </li>
     <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the product
      1 * 2 * ... * N; choose a suitable data type so that some interesting
      computations can be performed! </li>
     <li> Enter the program "Gambler" from the lecture, and play around with
      it a bit. </li>
     <li> Improve the output of "Gambler":
      <ul>
       <li> Print out the inputs, with additional explanations. </li>
       <li> Print out the frequency wins/T (where T is the number of
        trials). </li>
       <li> Print out the probability stake/goal of winning. </li>
       <li> Print out the expected number of steps (stake)*(goal-stake).
       </li>
       <li> Finally determine the average and the maximum number of steps
        it took to finish a trial (that is, the number of steps until cash
        either is 0 or goal), and print it out. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.3.8 - 1.3.31 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>). </li>
    </ol>
    See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Week00_Friday"> here </a>
    for solutions.
   </li>
   <li> Week 5 (5/11/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Enter program "Deck" from the lecture, understand it, run it. </li>
     <li> Write another program, which uses only a deck of 32 cards, where
      the ranks do not include 2 up to 6. </li>
     <li> Now combine both programs into one, where via a command-line argument
      it is decided whether 32 or 52 cards are to be used. </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.4.1 - 1.4.5 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.4.35 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 6 (12/11/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.5.1 - 1.5.3 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/15inout/"> here</a>):
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program that reads in integers (as many as the user
        enters) from standard input and prints out the maximum and minimum
        values. Before entering the program, make a sketch on paper. </li>
       <li> Modify this program by rejecting non-positive entries, asking the
        user to re-enter the input (until he gets it correct). Before
       entering the program, extend the previous sketch. Hint: a while-loop
       is appropriate for testing the input values.</li>
       <li> Read N from the command-line and N floating-point number from
        standard input, and compute their mean value. Create an error message
        if not enough numbers were entered. Compute also the standard
        deviation as the square root of the sum of the squares of the
        differences from these numbers and the average, the whole then divided
        by N-1. Hint: For this computation you could store the numbers in
        an array. </li>
      </ol>
      Always test your programs thoroughly!
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.5.7 from the book: Read in N from the
      command-line plus N-1 integers from 1 to N from standard input, assuming
      that these numbers are different. Now determine the missing number (from
      the interval 1 .. N). </li>
     <li> As an additional exercise, improve
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">PlotFilter.java</a>
      by not asking for the minimum x/y values, but computing them from
      the input (so the first four special doubles from standard input are not
      needed anymore). Test with
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">USA.txt</a>, where you
      removed the first four numbers.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 7 (19/11/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.1 - 2.1.4 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> As additional exercises you can consider 2.1.13, 2.1.14 and 2.1.17.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 8 (26/11/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> If you didn't finish the exercises from last week, then please
      finish them now (we are still on functions). </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.5, 2.1.12, 2.1.18, 2.1.19 and 2.1.20
      from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> For exercise 2.1.18, if for example the input is the array
      (1,3,7), then the output should be (0,3/7,1). And if the
      input is (-10,-4,-1), then the output should be (0,6/9,1).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <!--
   <li> Week 5, Friday, 6/11/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Write a class <code>StringExample</code>:
      <ul>
        <li> Containing (static) constants <code>size_a</code> of
        value 4 and array <code>a</code> containing the four strings "AB",
        "XYZ", "EFG", "1234". </li>
        <li> We also have <code>size_b</code> of value 3, and array
         <code>b</code> containing the three strings "M1", "T3", "y6". </li>
       <li> Furthermore we have a static function <code>check_a</code> which
        takes one string argument, and returns integers from 0 to 3 if the
        string occurs in array <code>a</code> with that index, while otherwise
        -1 is returned. </li>
       <li> And in the same vein we have <code>check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> Both functions must use a loop for checking the membership in the
        respective array. </li>
       <li> The main programs reads pairs of strings from standard input (as
        long as standard input has not been closed), and prints out the results
        of <code>check_a, check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> For example "EFG T3" results in "2 1", and "X y6" results in
        "-1 2". </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/StringExample.java">
       the solution </a>.
     </li>
     <li> Counting random events:
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program (class) "RandomNumbers" which takes two
        command-line arguments M and N. </li>
       <li> The program then creates N many random integers in the interval
        [1, M], counts how often each of these integers occurs, and then
        prints out the relative frequency for each of these M numbers (that is,
        the quotient "occurrences / N"). </li>
       <li> Your program should work for large N, and thus should not store
        the N random numbers computed. </li>
       <li> For the creation of the random integer write a function
        <code>random(M)</code>, which takes M as parameter, and returns a
        random integer from 1 to M. </li>
       <li> Hint: you need to use an integer-array of size M for performing
        the counting. </li>
      </ol>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/RandomNumbers.java">
       the solution </a>.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 6+7, Friday 13/11/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Libraries:
      <ol>
       <li> Implement the library class StdStats with (just) the static
        functions "min", "max" and "mean". </li>
       <li> Write a program "Stats" which is called with floating point
        numbers as command-line parameters, and which computes their
        minimum, maximum and average, using your library StdStats. </li>
       <li> For example, "Stats 4 5.2" would yield min=4, max=5.2,
        mean=4.6. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Recursion:
      <ol>
       <li> Enter the program "Htree" from the lecture. </li>
       <li> Write a modified program "Htree2", which asks for confirmation
        before continuing drawing parts of the tree. </li>
       <li> Also print out appropriate messages, so that you can follow in
        detail the recursion. </li>
       <li> Run the program for inputs up to 4, and make sure you understand
        what's going on! </li>
      </ol>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Section3/Htree2.java">
       a solution </a>.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 8, Friday, 20/11/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Use the data types "Color" and "Picture" from the lecture (see
      above). </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.2 from the book: Write a program that takes from the
     command-line three integers from 0 to 255 (representing red, green
     and blue), and then creates and shows a 256-by-256 picture of that
     colour. </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.3 from the book: Modify program "AlbersSquares" to take
      nine command-line arguments, representing now three colours, and then
      draw the 3*2=6 squares showing all the Albers squares with the large
      square in each colour and the small square in each different colour.
     </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.6 from the book: Write a program that takes the name of
     a picture file as a command-line input, and creates three images, one
     that contains only the red components, one for green, and one for blue.
     </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.4 from the book:
      <ul>
       <li> Write a program that takes the name of a grayscale picture-file
        as a command-line argument, and plots a histogram of the frequency
        of occurrences of each of the 256 grayscale intensities. </li>
       <li> Use the library "StdStats" from Section 2.2 (provided
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Section2"> here </a>). </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 9, Friday, 27/11/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Creating and using a trivial class:
      <ul>
       <li> Write a class <code>Trivial</code>, which stores two integers (via
        the constructor), and as member functions ("methods") allows to
        compute their sum and to translate the object into a string. </li>
       <li> Write then a program which reads four integers from the
        command-line, creates two objects of type <code>Trivial</code>
        accordingly, and outputs their sums and the objects themselves. </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Trivial.java">
       the Trivial-solution </a>, and here is the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Client.java"> Client </a>.
     </li>
     <li> Study "Charge.java" and "Potential.java", understand how it works,
      and play a bit around (using for example "charges.txt" as input). </li>
     <li> Study "Turtle.java" and the application "Spiral.java"; again, play
      a bit around with it, and write your own clients of class Turtle,
      creating some simple turtle-graphics. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 10, Friday, 4/12/2009: Understanding the (new) Poker
    class-collection:
    <ol>
     <li> Add to the Card-class a test-function (that is, a "main"-function)
      which creates a couple of cards using the two constructors and
      prints them out. </li>
     <li> Here is a possible
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Card.java">
       solution </a>. </li>
     <li> Extending the analysis capabilities:
      <ul>
       <li> Copy Poker.java to PokerExtended.java (and, of course, update
        the class-name accordingly). </li>
       <li> Now for the case N=0 (where an input-hand is to be analysed),
        add code to show for the 1+5+10=16 exchange possibilities what is
        the best and the worst case which could arise. </li>
       <li> Hint: You just need to apply the given capabilities. </li>
       <li> Evaluation is done by class "Evaluation" (for no big surprise).
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Here is the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/PokerExtended.java">
       extended version </a>. </li>
     <li> Note that this program compiles, but it cannot run successfully
      until you implement the missing functionality. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 11, Friday, 4/12/2009: Using and changing some data type.
    <ul>
     <li> Consider Storage.java from the Poker class-collection (available
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Storage.java">
       here </a>).
     </li>
     <li> First you need to understand the API; so try to understand
      the public members of this class.
     </li>
     <li> Some examples for using this class are already given in the
      test function.
     </li>
     <li> Write a client program which takes N from the command-line,
      stores the products i*j for 1 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt;= N in a Storage-object,
      and outputs the Storage-object.
     </li>
     <li> Now change the implementation (only(!) - not the interface!),
      by just using a two-dimensional array (instead of the one-dimensional
      array as we have it now). </li>
     <li> For that you just need to change the implementations of the
      constructor and of the get/set-functions, and, of course, the definition
      of the instance-variable "results". </li>
     <li> The function "index" is no longer needed. </li>
     <li> The main-function as well as your client must work as before,
      without any need for changing the code, and without changes in the
      observable behaviour.
     </li>
     <li> Recall that a two-dimensional integer array is declared via, e.g.,
      <code>int[][] a;</code>, initialised via, e.g., <code>a = new int[3][4];
      </code>, and used by, e.g., <code>a[2][3] = 77</code>.
     </li>
     <li> Remark on this alternative implementation: It uses more memory,
      but access is quicker, since no index-computations are necessary.
      This is a typical situation, using different implementations for
      trading time versus space.
     </li>
     <li> Since we cannot use inheritance yet, usage of the two implementations
      is a bit clumsy, since we need to have two files "Storage.java"
      somewhere (containing the two implementations), and then to copy one or
      the other into the directory with our application. </li>
     <li> Inheritance allows one to define one "interface class" "Storage",
      which is abstract, and then to define various classes implementing
      this interface, like "StorageFast" and "StorageSmall".
     </li>
     <li> Final remark: Of course, for coursework II only the original files
      are to be used (though it will also work with the alternative
      implementation, of course).
     </li>
    </ul>
    Here is the <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week11"> solution </a>
    (see the sub-directories for old and new versions of Storage.java).
    Altogether 4 programs can be compiled and run:
    <ol>
     <li> The two Storage-programs ("New" and "Old", each with its
      test-program). </li>
     <li> The two versions of the Client-program, using the two versions of
      the Storage-class. </li>
    </ol>
    See the files for how to compile and run these four programs.
   </li>
  </ul>

   <li> Anything else will result in a deduction of 50 percent! (The same will
    hold for the second coursework.) </li>
   <li> This is to make sure that you really concentrate on the essentials,
    and don't copy-and-paste code (which usually contains a lot of noise).
   </li>
   <li> In total you can get 100 marks for this exercise. There are three
   parts:
    <ol>
     <li> Rewrite the program <code>Shuffle</code> from the lecture, now using
      your own (good!) variable names, and making constants <code>final</code>.
      <ul>
       <li> Another change is that no cards are shuffled, but just numbers
        from 1 to N, where N is to be read from the command line. </li>
       <li> So the output of the program is a random permutation of the
        sequence 1, ..., N. </li>
       <li> Try in general to make this little program as nice as possible.
       </li>
       <li> Explain also in your own words how it works. </li>
       <li> This exercise is worth <strong>20%</strong>. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Run computational experiments to check that your shuffling code
      works as advertised.
      <ul>
       <li> Write a program <code>ShuffleTest</code> that takes command-line
        arguments M and N, does N shuffles of an array of size M that is
        initialised with a[i] = i before each shuffle, and prints an M-by-M
        table such that row i gives the number of times i wound up in position
        j for all j. </li>
       <li> All entries in the array should be close to N/M (if your shuffling
        works). </li>
       <li> Explain your program. </li>
       <li> This exercise is worth <strong>50%</strong>. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Bad shuffling.
      <ul>
       <li> Suppose that you choose a random integer between 0 and N-1 in our
        shuffling code instead of one between i and N-1. </li>
       <li> Show that the resulting order is not equally likely to be one of
        the N! possibilities. </li>
       <li> Use Run <code>ShuffleTest</code> for this version, with decent
        values of N and M (so that it takes some time, and the statistical
        quality is high). </li>
       <li> Document your findings, and explain why this form of shuffling
        is bad. </li>
       <li> This exercise is worth <strong>30%</strong>. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h4> Solution </h4>

  <ul>
   <li> The three programs are
    <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201011/One/Shuffle.jave"> Shuffle </a>,
    <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201011/One/ShuffleTest.jave"> ShuffleTest </a>,
    <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201011/One/BadShuffleTest.jave"> BadShuffleTest </a>.
   </li>
   <li> A typical output is, where, to show you an alternative, compilation
    didn't use <code>javac</code> but <code>gcj</code>, via
    <pre> One> gcj -O3 BadShuffleTest.java --main=BadShuffleTest </pre>
    (which produces a native(!) binary, just called "a.out", since no other
    name was specified):

<!--
  <h3> First coursework </h3>
  
  <ul>
   <li> A program "Poker.java" has to be written, consisting of the class
    "Poker", and this file has be sent via e-mail to me (just a single file).
   </li>
   <li> You are encouraged to use the libraries <code>StdIn</code> and
    <code>StdOut</code> (you don't need to include them in your submission).
   </li>
   <li> This program shall take one command-line argument N. </li>
   <li> For N=0 the following should happen:
    <ol>
     <li> A hand of (five) cards is read from standard input, where each
      card comes in the form "Jack of Clubs" etc. (as we had it in the
      example from the lecture). </li>
     <li> Additional spaces (or space symbols like end-of-line symbols or
      tab-symbols) must not matter. </li>
     <li> The names of suites (for input) are "Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts,
      Spades". </li>
     <li> The names of the card ranks (for input) are "2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
      10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace". </li>
     <li> The program then determines which of the following nine standard
      hand ranks (in order from highest to lowest)
      <ol>
       <li> Straight flush (a straight and a flush - see below) </li>
       <li> Four of a kind (four equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> Full house (two equal card ranks together with three equal card
       ranks) </li>
       <li> Flush (all cards of same suit) </li>
       <li> Straight (cards in rank order, where the ace can be used as
       the lowest or the highest card rank) </li>
       <li> Three of a kind (three equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> Two pairs (two times two equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> One pair (two equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> High card (none of the above). </li>
      </ol>
      applies for the hand, where in case of several possibilities the higher
      rank has to be output. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> For N > 0 the program chooses itself N random hands, counts how often
    each of the above hand ranks occurs, and outputs the relative frequency of
    each rank, that is, the quotients (number of occurrences) / N. </li>
   <li> You need to determine for which N the values are really close to the
    correct probabilities, and in a comment in your program you need to
    show such N and the output produced by your program. </li>
   <li> This <a href="Examples/Coursework_I.tar.gz"> archive </a> contains
    examples - your program must be able to classify all these hands
    correctly. </li>
   <li> Very important:
    <ol>
     <li> Your program must compile. </li>
     <li> Your program must run. </li>
     <li> It must produce correct results. </li>
     <li> Try to give good error messages in case some user input is wrong.
     </li>
     <li> Use good variable names. </li>
     <li> Declare variables as local as possible. </li>
     <li> Use many <strong>functions</strong>. </li>
     <li> Specify the meaning of functions and important variables via
      comments. </li>
     <li> <strong>Important:</strong> The program must be written solely by
      you! I won't accept any two similar programs. </li>
     <li> If you do not implement the full functionality (for example, you
      cannot determine all hand ranks), then please state this clearly
      in your comments. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Hints:
    <ol>
     <li> Every non-trivial program has to be first <strong>designed</strong>
      on paper. </li>
     <li> Of fundamental importance is to determine how to handle the various
      object classes! Here we have "suites", "card ranks", "cards" (a
      combination of suit and card rank), "hands" (five cards) and "hand
      ranks". Perhaps you find it useful to use additional object classes.
     </li>
     <li> Strings are <strong>not</strong> appropriate data types (except for
      input and output).
     </li>
     <li> Best is to use codes, like 1 .. 52 for the cards, 1 .. 4 for the
      suites, 1 .. 13 for the card ranks, and 1 .. 9 for the hand ranks. </li>
     <li> One could represent cards as pairs of suit and card rank, but yet we
      don't have the appropriate means for doing so, and using codes 1 .. 52
      is easiest. </li>
     <li> You can use modular arithmetic to handle these codes somewhat more
      elegantly, but this is not needed. </li>
     <li> Hands (of cards) are represented as arrays (of five cards). </li>
     <li> Provide functions for extracting the suit-code and the
      card-rank-code from a card-code. </li>
     <li> When reading cards from (standard) input, you read in single strings,
      and then you need to compare the input string <em>objects</em> to
      given strings in order to compute the codes. Use the member function
      "String.equals" for that. </li>
     <li> Thus provide functions which convert strings for card ranks and
      strings for suites to the respective codes. </li>
     <li> Conversely you need functions which convert codes into the strings.
     </li>
     <li> As said before, don't use strings for computations, but only for
      input and output. All computations are best performed using
      "mathematical" representations of the objects, suitable for computation.
      Strings are just means for input and output, except, of course,
      the computations are actually computations on strings, as in text or
      word processing. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Here is a <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/One/Poker.java">
     model solution </a>.
   </li>
  </ul>


  <h3> Second coursework </h3>

  <p>
   Now we <em>play</em> poker (the simplest version).
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> Deadline is Monday, 21/12/2009; submission as before via e-mail. </li>
   <li> The code must be written in all parts solely by you (otherwise zero
    marks are the result, potentially followed by disciplinary actions). </li>
   <li> This time you need to add code to a couple of files; send me an
    archive of the changed files, plus an additional file named
    "StudNumber_Coursework_2.txt" (plain text), where you state your name
    (while the student number is in the name of that file), and where
    you state and explain the places where you added code. </li>
   <li> Reminder: As usual with electronic submission, your submission of
    coursework implicitly contains your signature under the following
    standard phrase from the Coursework Submission Form:
    <p>
     <cite> I am aware of the University policy on unfair practice and I
      certify that this coursework is the result of my own independent work
      except where otherwise stated, and that all other sources are explicitly
      acknowledged. </cite>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li> We only consider a simple form of "draw poker":
    <ol>
     <li> After the cards are dealt, the player can choose up to
      2 cards to be exchanged. </li>
     <li> After exchange, all hands are shown (we do not
      do betting), and the winner is determined. </li>
     <li> We only consider two players. </li>
     <li> The task is to complete the framework, to devise some strategies
      for card exchange, and to play a tournament with your strategies,
      determining what works best. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> No classes (from the Java library or elsewhere) may be used except
    those provided with the coursework. </li>
   <li> The code is only to be changed at the marked places (you find "XXX"
    there), while the rest must remain untouched. </li>
   <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/"> Here </a> are the
    files you need to consider. </li>
   <li> Your first task is to study the code carefully! You need to understand
   (and partially reconstruct) the API of all classes. </li>
   <li> To get into it, start considering
    <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Poker.java"> Poker.java
    </a>:
    <ol>
     <li> This implements the functionality from the first coursework, now
      using the new framework. </li>
     <li> Additionally, while in the first coursework only the "major ranking"
      of hands into the nine major poker ranks has been considered, now
      the complete ranking is provided. </li>
     <li> So now there are 6331 hand ranks (while there are 9 major hand
      ranks): A hand wins against another hand if and only if its hand rank
      is (strictly) better, that is, numerically lower, than that of the other
      hand. </li>
     <li> "java Poker 0" works already, but "java Poker N" for N>0 doesn't work
      yet, since you have to complete first the
      <code>Bank</code>-implementation. </li>
     <li> The code here using <code>Bank</code> is one example for the usage
      of this class, which you can study, in order to find out what precisely
      is the API for the <code>Bank</code>-class (in this case). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The places where functions have to be completed are the following
    (NOW (22/1/2010) these files contain already the solutions):
    <ol>
     <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Bank.java"> Bank.java
      </a>: functionality regarding dealing and exchanging cards. </li>
     <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Evaluation.java">
       Evaluation.java </a>: computing all possible outcomes for one exchange
      request. </li>
     <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/TwoPlayers.java">
       TwoPlayers.java </a>: Using all available strategies for one play
      between two players, and determining the results. </li>
     <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Tournament.java">
       Tournament.java </a>: the main program, letting the strategies play
     against each other for many rounds, and displaying the results. </li>
     <li> Completing this functionality can is worth roughly 50-60% of the
      coursework, while the rest is earned by implement various exchange
      strategies in
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Strategy.java">
       Strategy.java </a>. </li>
     <li> It is your task to determine the precise specifications for all
      these places. </li>
     <li> If needed, you may add new private member functions, but no data
      member (static or non-static) shall be added, and none of the existing
      code is to be altered. </li>
    </ol>
    You will find there already certain code-fragments and hints, to get
    you started.
   </li>
   <li> This exercise is about DESIGN: Yet you cannot create larger systems
    (with good design), and so the framework is given to you, and you have
    to grasp it, and to complete it. </li>
   <li> And regarding the strategies, you can show some creativity. </li>
   <li> Until Monday, 7/12/2009, there might occur some (small) changes
    in the framework (if it makes the task easier). </li>
   <li> In the lecture next Friday (4/12/2009) certain key elements of
    the framework will be discussed. </li>
  </ul>
