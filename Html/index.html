  <h2> Messages </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> The lecture on Friday, 7/12/2009 (11-12), is on Section 3.3 in
    the book. </li>
   <li> On <strong>Friday 11/12/2009 from 14-15</strong> we have an additional
    lecture, discussing what to do over the Christmas break (not just
    collecting presents <img src="images/HAPPI_Frown.png" alt="so well"/>).
   </li>
   <li> See below for <strong>Coursework 2</strong>; deadline is Monday,
    21/12/2009. </li>
  </ul>

  
  <h2> General information </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> First week (22/9/2009 - 25/9/2009):
    <ol>
     <li> Lectures 11:30 - 13:30 in the Robert Recorde room. </li>
     <li> Lab sessions from 14:00 - 16:00 in the Linux lab (room 217). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> From 28/9/2009 to 4/12/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Friday, 11-12 the lecture takes place in the Robert Recorde room.
     </li>
     <li> Friday 13-14 we have the lab session (in the Linux lab). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the lab sessions:
    <ol>
     <li> Active participation in all lab session is awarded 10% of the
      overall module marks. </li>
     <li> For each lab sessions tasks are distributed, related to the
      accompanying lecture (from the same day). </li>
     <li> During the lab session, work on these tasks is expected. </li>
     <li> "Active participation" means that during the whole lab session
      reasonable work related to the module is performed, typically related
      to the current tasks, but possibly also related to previous tasks,
      or to other questions or problems (of course, related to the module).
     </li>
     <li> There are no tests (or exams) in the labs. Every student present for
      the full time and doing reasonable work gets acknowledged his/her
      active participation. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Assessment:
    <ol>
     <li> 10% is allocated to active participation in the lab sessions. </li>
     <li> Roughly in week 4 and week 7 two courseworks are handed out,
      each worth 20%. </li>
     <li> The remaining 50% is the January exam. </li>
     <li> The exam is based on what we did in the lectures, the lab sessions,
      and the coursework. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Lab sessions </h2>

  <p>
   Remark: If some answer is already given, then <em>understand</em> why
   this is the correct answer.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> Week 0:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday: The Exercises from Section 1.1 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/11hello/"> here </a> at the
      bottom, Exercises 1 - 5).
     </li>
     <li> Wednesday:
      <ol>
       <li> Enter the five programs from the lecture, run them with all sorts
        of different arguments, understand the outcome. </li>
       <li> Especially try to <em>crash</em> the programs (missing or
        strange inputs, very large or very small numbers, ...). </li>
       <li> You might also have a look at the improved programs. </li>
       <li> After you did this for some time, consider the exercises from
        Section 1.2 (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/12types/"> here </a>
        at the bottom, Exercises 1 - 23).
        <ul>
         <li> Exercises 1.2.1 - 1.2.14 are about understanding expressions.
         </li>
         <li> Write little programs which compute the expressions, possibly
          for all inputs (especially in the case of boolean expressions).
          </li>
          <li> If you wish to write a new program, consider 1.2.14 - 1.2.23.
          </li>
         </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Thursday:
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program which reads two integers and prints them out sorted
        in ascending order. </li>
       <li> Write another program which reads three integers and prints them
        out sorted in ascending order. </li>
       <li> Write a better version of "TenHellos.java" (printing "Hello World!"
        ten times), using a while-loop. </li>
       <li> Consider exercises 1.3.1 - 1.3.7 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>);
        perhaps first considering exercises 1, 3, 4 (perhaps writing a complete
        program), 6 (again perhaps writing programs to testing your answer)
        and 7. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Friday:
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the sum
        1 + 2 + ... + N. </li>
       <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the product
        1 * 2 * ... * N; choose a suitable data type so that some interesting
       computations can be performed! </li>
       <li> Enter the program "Gambler" from the lecture, and play around with
        it a bit. </li>
       <li> Improve the output of "Gambler":
        <ul>
         <li> Print out the inputs, with additional explanations. </li>
         <li> Print out the frequency wins/T (where T is the number of
          trials). </li>
         <li> Print out the probability stake/goal of winning. </li>
         <li> Print out the expected number of steps (stake)*(goal-stake).
         </li>
         <li> Finally determine the average and the maximum number of steps
          it took to finish a trial (that is, the number of steps until cash
          either is 0 or goal), and print it out. </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li> Consider exercises 1.3.8 - 1.3.31 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>). </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 1, Friday, 2/10/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Enter program "Deck" from the lecture, understand it, run it. </li>
     <li> Write another program, which uses only a deck of 32 cards, where
      the ranks do not include 2 up to 6. </li>
     <li> Now combine both programs into one, where via a command-line argument
      it is decided whether 32 or 52 cards are to be used. </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.4.1 - 1.4.5 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.4.35 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 2, Friday, 9/10/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Today we want mainly learn how to use the three libraries
      StdIn.java, StdOut.java, and StdDraw.java. </li>
     <li> Write programs "RandomSeq" for printing out a sequence of N random
      floating-point numbers (to standard output), and "Average" for reading
      floating-point numbers from standard input and computing their average.
      </li>
     <li> Play a bit around with redirecting input and output, and pipe the
      two programs together. </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.5.1 - 1.5.3 from the book:
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program that reads in integers (as many as the user
        enters) from standard input and prints out the maximum and minimum
        values. Before entering the program, make a sketch on paper. </li>
       <li> Modify this program by rejecting non-positive entries, asking the
        user to re-enter the input (until he gets it correct). Before
       entering the program, extend the previous sketch. Hint: a while-loop
       is appropriate for testing the input values.</li>
       <li> Read N from the command-line and N floating-point number from
        standard input, and compute their mean value. Create an error message
        if not enough numbers were entered. Compute also the standard
        deviation as the square root of the sum of the squares of the
        differences from these numbers and the average, the whole then divided
        by N-1. Hint: For this computation you could store the numbers in
        an array. </li>
      </ol>
      Always test your programs thoroughly!
     </li>
     <li> Write  program "SinFunction" that plots the function sin(4x)+sin(20x)
      (see the lecture script). </li>
     <li> If you have still time, or as a little home work, consider exercise
      1.5.7 from the book: Read in N from the command-line plus N-1 integers
      from 1 to N from standard input, assuming that these numbers are
      different. Now determine the missing number (from the interval 1 .. N).
      </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 3, Friday, 16/10/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.1 - 2.1.4 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> As additional exercises you can consider 2.1.13, 2.1.14 and 2.1.17.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 4, Friday, 23/10/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> If you didn't finish the exercises from last week, you might
      finish them now. </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.18, 2.1.19 and 2.1.20 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Friday, 30/10/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> This lab session is for <strong>catching up!</strong> </li>
     <li> No new exercises --- please consider the exercises from previous
      weeks you didn't do. </li>
     <li> Functions are very important, so also if you are doing exercises
      from previous weeks not involving functions, do them now with functions.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 5, Friday, 6/11/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Write a class <code>StringExample</code>:
      <ul>
        <li> Containing (static) constants <code>size_a</code> of
        value 4 and array <code>a</code> containing the four strings "AB",
        "XYZ", "EFG", "1234". </li>
        <li> We also have <code>size_b</code> of value 3, and array
         <code>b</code> containing the three strings "M1", "T3", "y6". </li>
       <li> Furthermore we have a static function <code>check_a</code> which
        takes one string argument, and returns integers from 0 to 3 if the
        string occurs in array <code>a</code> with that index, while otherwise
        -1 is returned. </li>
       <li> And in the same vein we have <code>check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> Both functions must use a loop for checking the membership in the
        respective array. </li>
       <li> The main programs reads pairs of strings from standard input (as
        long as standard input has not been closed), and prints out the results
        of <code>check_a, check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> For example "EFG T3" results in "2 1", and "X y6" results in
        "-1 2". </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/StringExample.java">
       the solution </a>.
     </li>
     <li> Counting random events:
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program (class) "RandomNumbers" which takes two
        command-line arguments M and N. </li>
       <li> The program then creates N many random integers in the interval
        [1, M], counts how often each of these integers occurs, and then
        prints out the relative frequency for each of these M numbers (that is,
        the quotient "occurrences / N"). </li>
       <li> Your program should work for large N, and thus should not store
        the N random numbers computed. </li>
       <li> For the creation of the random integer write a function
        <code>random(M)</code>, which takes M as parameter, and returns a
        random integer from 1 to M. </li>
       <li> Hint: you need to use an integer-array of size M for performing
        the counting. </li>
      </ol>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/RandomNumbers.java">
       the solution </a>.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 6+7, Friday 13/11/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Libraries:
      <ol>
       <li> Implement the library class StdStats with (just) the static
        functions "min", "max" and "mean". </li>
       <li> Write a program "Stats" which is called with floating point
        numbers as command-line parameters, and which computes their
        minimum, maximum and average, using your library StdStats. </li>
       <li> For example, "Stats 4 5.2" would yield min=4, max=5.2,
        mean=4.6. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Recursion:
      <ol>
       <li> Enter the program "Htree" from the lecture. </li>
       <li> Write a modified program "Htree2", which asks for confirmation
        before continuing drawing parts of the tree. </li>
       <li> Also print out appropriate messages, so that you can follow in
        detail the recursion. </li>
       <li> Run the program for inputs up to 4, and make sure you understand
        what's going on! </li>
      </ol>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Section3/Htree2.java">
       a solution </a>.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 8, Friday, 20/11/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Use the data types "Color" and "Picture" from the lecture (see
      above). </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.2 from the book: Write a program that takes from the
     command-line three integers from 0 to 255 (representing red, green
     and blue), and then creates and shows a 256-by-256 picture of that
     colour. </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.3 from the book: Modify program "AlbersSquares" to take
      nine command-line arguments, representing now three colours, and then
      draw the 3*2=6 squares showing all the Albers squares with the large
      square in each colour and the small square in each different colour.
     </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.6 from the book: Write a program that takes the name of
     a picture file as a command-line input, and creates three images, one
     that contains only the red components, one for green, and one for blue.
     </li>
     <li> Exercise 3.1.4 from the book:
      <ul>
       <li> Write a program that takes the name of a grayscale picture-file
        as a command-line argument, and plots a histogram of the frequency
        of occurrences of each of the 256 grayscale intensities. </li>
       <li> Use the library "StdStats" from Section 2.2 (provided
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Section2"> here </a>). </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 9, Friday, 27/11/2009:
    <ol>
     <li> Creating and using a trivial class:
      <ul>
       <li> Write a class <code>Trivial</code>, which stores two integers (via
        the constructor), and as member functions ("methods") allows to
        compute their sum and to translate the object into a string. </li>
       <li> Write then a program which reads four integers from the
        command-line, creates two objects of type <code>Trivial</code>
        accordingly, and outputs their sums and the objects themselves. </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Trivial.java">
       the Trivial-solution </a>, and here is the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Client.java"> Client </a>.
     </li>
     <li> Study "Charge.java" and "Potential.java", understand how it works,
      and play a bit around (using for example "charges.txt" as input). </li>
     <li> Study "Turtle.java" and the application "Spiral.java"; again, play
      a bit around with it, and write your own clients of class Turtle,
      creating some simple turtle-graphics. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 10, Friday, 4/12/2009: Understanding the (new) Poker
    class-collection:
    <ol>
     <li> Add to the Card-class a test-function (that is, a "main"-function)
      which creates a couple of cards using the two constructors and
      prints them out. </li>
     <li> Here is a possible
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Card.java">
       solution </a>. </li>
     <li> Extending the analysis capabilities:
      <ul>
       <li> Copy Poker.java to PokerExtended.java (and, of course, update
        the class-name accordingly). </li>
       <li> Now for the case N=0 (where an input-hand is to be analysed),
        add code to show for the 1+5+10=16 exchange possibilities what is
        the best and the worst case which could arise. </li>
       <li> Hint: You just need to apply the given capabilities. </li>
       <li> Evaluation is done by class "Evaluation" (for no big surprise).
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Here is the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/PokerExtended.java">
       extended version </a>. </li>
     <li> Note that this program compiles, but it cannot run succesfully
      until you implement the missing functionality. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 11, Friday, 4/12/2009: Using and changing some data type.
    <ul>
     <li> Consider Storage.java from the Poker class-collection (available
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Storage.java">
       here </a>).
     </li>
     <li> First you need to understand the API; so try to understand
      the public members of this class.
     </li>
     <li> Some examples for using this class are already given in the
      test function.
     </li>
     <li> Write a client program which takes N from the command-line,
      stores the products i*j for 1 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt;= N in a Storage-object,
      and outputs the Storage-object.
     </li>
     <li> Now change the implementation (only(!) --- not the interface!),
      by just using a two-dimensional array (instead of the one-dimensional
      array as we have it now). </li>
     <li> For that you just need to change the implementations of the
      constructor and of the get/set-functions, and, of course, the definition
      of the instance-variable "results". </li>
     <li> The function "index" is no longer needed. </li>
     <li> The main-function as well as your client must work as before,
      without any need for changing the code, and without changes in the
      observable behaviour.
     </li>
     <li> Recall that a two-dimensional integer array is declared via, e.g.,
      <code>int[][] a;</code>, initialised via, e.g., <code>a = new int[3][4];
      </code>, and used by, e.g., <code>a[2][3] = 77</code>.
     </li>
     <li> Remark on this alternative implementation: It uses more memory,
      but access is quicker, since no index-computations are necessary.
      This is a typical situation, using different implementations for
      trading time versus space.
     </li>
     <li> Since we cannot use inheritance yet, usage of the two implementations
      is a bit clumsy, since we need to have two files "Storage.java"
      somewhere (containing the two implementations), and then to copy one or
      the other into the directory with our application. </li>
     <li> Inheritance allows one to define one "interface class" "Storage",
      which is abstract, and then to define various classes implementing
      this interface, like "StorageFast" and "StorageSmall".
     </li>
     <li> Final remark: Of course, for coursework II only the original files
      are to be used (though it will also work with the alternative
      implementation, of course).
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>

  

  <h2> Coursework </h2>

  <h3> First coursework </h3>

  <ul>
   <li> A program "Poker.java" has to be written, consisting of the class
    "Poker", and this file has be sent via e-mail to me (just a single file).
   </li>
   <li> You are encouraged to use the libraries <code>StdIn</code> and
    <code>StdOut</code> (you don't need to include them in your submission).
   </li>
   <li> This program shall take one command-line argument N. </li>
   <li> For N=0 the following should happen:
    <ol>
     <li> A hand of (five) cards is read from standard input, where each
      card comes in the form "Jack of Clubs" etc. (as we had it in the
      example from the lecture). </li>
     <li> Additional spaces (or space symbols like end-of-line symbols or
      tab-symbols) must not matter. </li>
     <li> The names of suites (for input) are "Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts,
      Spades". </li>
     <li> The names of the card ranks (for input) are "2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
      10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace". </li>
     <li> The program then determines which of the following nine standard
      hand ranks (in order from highest to lowest)
      <ol>
       <li> Straight flush (a straight and a flush -- see below) </li>
       <li> Four of a kind (four equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> Full house (two equal card ranks together with three equal card
       ranks) </li>
       <li> Flush (all cards of same suit) </li>
       <li> Straight (cards in rank order, where the ace can be used as
       the lowest or the highest card rank) </li>
       <li> Three of a kind (three equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> Two pairs (two times two equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> One pair (two equal card ranks) </li>
       <li> High card (none of the above). </li>
      </ol>
      applies for the hand, where in case of several possibilities the higher
      rank has to be output. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> For N > 0 the program chooses itself N random hands, counts how often
    each of the above hand ranks occurs, and outputs the relative frequency of
    each rank, that is, the quotients (number of occurrences) / N. </li>
   <li> You need to determine for which N the values are really close to the
    correct probabilities, and in a comment in your program you need to
    show such N and the output produced by your program. </li>
   <li> This <a href="Examples/Coursework_I.tar.gz"> archive </a> contains
    examples --- your program must be able to classify all these hands
    correctly. </li>
   <li> Very important:
    <ol>
     <li> Your program must compile. </li>
     <li> Your program must run. </li>
     <li> It must produce correct results. </li>
     <li> Try to give good error messages in case some user input is wrong.
     </li>
     <li> Use good variable names. </li>
     <li> Declare variables as local as possible. </li>
     <li> Use many <strong>functions</strong>. </li>
     <li> Specify the meaning of functions and important variables via
      comments. </li>
     <li> <strong>Important:</strong> The program must be written solely by
      you! I won't accept any two similar programs. </li>
     <li> If you do not implement the full functionality (for example, you
      cannot determine all hand ranks), then please state this clearly
      in your comments. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Hints:
    <ol>
     <li> Every non-trivial program has to be first <strong>designed</strong>
      on paper. </li>
     <li> Of fundamental importance is to determine how to handle the various
      object classes! Here we have "suites", "card ranks", "cards" (a
      combination of suit and card rank), "hands" (five cards) and "hand
      ranks". Perhaps you find it useful to use additional object classes.
     </li>
     <li> Strings are <strong>not</strong> appropriate data types (except for
      input and output).
     </li>
     <li> Best is to use codes, like 1 .. 52 for the cards, 1 .. 4 for the
      suites, 1 .. 13 for the card ranks, and 1 .. 9 for the hand ranks. </li>
     <li> One could represent cards as pairs of suit and card rank, but yet we
      don't have the appropriate means for doing so, and using codes 1 .. 52
      is easiest. </li>
     <li> You can use modular arithmetic to handle these codes somewhat more
      elegantly, but this is not needed. </li>
     <li> Hands (of cards) are represented as arrays (of five cards). </li>
     <li> Provide functions for extracting the suit-code and the
      card-rank-code from a card-code. </li>
     <li> When reading cards from (standard) input, you read in single strings,
      and then you need to compare the input string <em>objects</em> to
      given strings in order to compute the codes. Use the member function
      "String.equals" for that. </li>
     <li> Thus provide functions which convert strings for card ranks and
      strings for suites to the respective codes. </li>
     <li> Conversely you need functions which convert codes into the strings.
     </li>
     <li> As said before, don't use strings for computations, but only for
      input and output. All computations are best performed using
      "mathematical" representations of the objects, suitable for computation.
      Strings are just means for input and output, except, of course,
      the computations are actually computations on strings, as in text or
      word processing. </li>
    </ol>

     model solution </a>.
   </li>
  </ul>


  <h3> Second coursework </h3>

  <p>
   Now we <em>play</em> poker (the simplest version).
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> Deadline is Monday, 21/12/2009; submission as before via e-mail. </li>
   <li> All students will need to demonstrate their code at the end of the
    examination period. Details regarding time and place will be announced
    soon. </li>
   <li> The code must be written in all parts solely by you (otherwise zero
    marks are the result, potentially followed by disciplinary actions). </li>
   <li> This time you need to add code to a couple of files; send me an
    archive of the changed files, plus an additional file named
    "StudNumber_Coursework_2.txt" (plain text), where you state your name
    (while the student number is in the name of that file), and where
    you state and explain the places where you added code. </li>
   <li> Reminder: As usual with electronic submission, your submission of
    coursework implicitly contains your signature under the following
    standard phrase from the Coursework Submission Form:
    <p>
     <cite> I am aware of the University policy on unfair practice and I
      certify that this coursework is the result of my own independent work
      except where otherwise stated, and that all other sources are explicitly
      acknowledged. </cite>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li> We only consider a simple form of "draw poker":
    <ol>
     <li> After the cards are dealt, the player can choose up to
      2 cards to be exchanged. </li>
     <li> After exchange, all hands are shown (we do not
      do betting), and the winner is determined. </li>
     <li> We only consider two players. </li>
     <li> The task is to complete the framework, to devise some strategies
      for card exchange, and to play a tournament with your strategies,
      determining what works best. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> No classes (from the Java library or elsewhere) may be used except
    those provided with the coursework. </li>
   <li> The code is only to be changed at the marked places (you find "XXX"
    there), while the rest must remain untouched. </li>
   <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/"> Here </a> are the
    files you need to consider. </li>
   <li> Your first task is to study the code carefully! You need to understand
   (and partially reconstruct) the API of all classes. </li>
   <li> To get into it, start considering
    <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Poker.java"> Poker.java
    </a>:
    <ol>
     <li> This implements the functionality from the first coursework, now
      using the new framework. </li>
     <li> Additionally, while in the first coursework only the "major ranking"
      of hands into the nine major poker ranks has been considered, now
      the complete ranking is provided. </li>
     <li> So now there are 6331 hand ranks (while there are 9 major hand
      ranks): A hand wins against another hand if and only if its hand rank
      is (strictly) better, that is, numerically lower, than that of the other
      hand. </li>
     <li> "java Poker 0" works already, but "java Poker N" for N>0 doesn't work
      yet, since you have to complete first the
      <code>Bank</code>-implementation. </li>
     <li> The code here using <code>Bank</code> is one example for the usage
      of this class, which you can study, in order to find out what precisely
      is the API for the <code>Bank</code>-class (in this case). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The places where functions have to be completed are the following:
    <ol>
     <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Bank.java"> Bank.java
      </a>: functionality regarding dealing and exchanging cards. </li>
     <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Evaluation.java">
       Evaluation.java </a>: computing all possible outcomes for one exchange
      request. </li>
     <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/TwoPlayers.java">
       TwoPlayers.java </a>: Using all available strategies for one play
      between two players, and determining the results. </li>
     <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Tournament.java">
       Tournament.java </a>: the main program, letting the strategies play
     against each other for many rounds, and displaying the results. </li>
     <li> Completing this functionality can is worth roughly 50-60% of the
      coursework, while the rest is earned by implement various exchange
      strategies in
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/200910/Two/Strategy.java">
       Strategy.java </a>. </li>
     <li> It is your task to determine the precise specifications for all
      these places. </li>
     <li> If needed, you may add new private member functions, but no data
      member (static or non-static) shall be added, and none of the existing
      code is to be altered. </li>
    </ol>
    You will find there already certain code-fragments and hints, to get
    you started.
   </li>
   <li> This exercise is about DESIGN: Yet you cannot create larger systems
    (with good design), and so the framework is given to you, and you have
    to grasp it, and to complete it. </li>
   <li> And regarding the strategies, you can show some creativity. </li>
   <li> Until Monday, 7/12/2009, there might occur some (small) changes
    in the framework (if it makes the task easier). </li>
   <li> In the lecture next Friday (4/12/2009) certain key elements of
    the framework will be discussed. </li>
  </ul>
