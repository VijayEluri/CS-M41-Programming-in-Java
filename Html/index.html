  <h1>CS-M41 Programming in Java 2014/15</h1>


  <h2> Messages </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> On Friday, 7/11/2014, the usual lecture 12-13 is converted into a
    lab session (as usual, in the Linux lab), to make sure that the first
    level (Chapter 1 in the book -- basic programming) is completed. </li>
   <li> First coursework is open. </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> General information </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> The url of this page is http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csoliver/ProgrammingJava201415_MgQxuCUrrS/index.html . </li>
   <li> First week (29/9/2014 - 3/10/2014):
    <ol>
     <li> One lab session Friday 10:00 - 11:00 in the Linux lab (room 217).
      <ol>
       <li> This can be a short session. </li>
       <li> The main task is to get used to the environment (knowing your
        password, etc.). </li>
       <li> Tasks:
        <ul>
         <li> Get your access information (username and password)
          from your e-mail. </lli>
         <li> Check that your login works. </li>
         <li> Access the course home page, and store the link. </li>
         <li> Browse the course home page, and get a bit familiar with it.
         </li>
         <li> <strong>Buy the book.</strong> </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> One lecture Friday 12:00 - 13:00 in the Robert Recorde room. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> From 6/10/2014 to 5/12/2014:
    <ol>
     <li> Monday, 13:00 - 15:00, "lecture-lab" session in the Linux lab
      (room 217). </li>
     <li> Friday 1-:00 - 11:00, "exercise-lab" session (Linux lab). </li>
     <li> Friday, 12:00 - 13:00, lecture in the Robert Recorde room.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the <strong>lecture-lab sessions</strong>:
    <ol>
     <li> In these sessions a mixture of teaching and programming
      practice takes place. </li>
     <li> We might not make use of all sessions. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the <strong>exercise-lab sessions</strong>:
    <ol>
     <li> Active participation in all exercise lab session is awarded 10% of
      the overall module marks. </li>
     <li> For each exercise lab sessions tasks are distributed. </li>
     <li> During the exercise lab session, work on these tasks is expected.
     </li>
     <li> "Active participation" means that during the whole lab session
      reasonable work related to the module is performed, typically related
      to the current tasks, but possibly also related to previous tasks,
      or to other questions or problems (of course, related to the module).
     </li>
     <li> There are no tests (or exams) in the labs. Every student present for
      the full time and doing reasonable work gets acknowledged his/her
      active participation. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Assessment:
    <ol>
     <li> 10% is allocated to active participation in the exercise lab
      sessions. </li>
     <li> Two courseworks are handed out, each worth 20%. </li>
     <li> The remaining 50% is the January exam. </li>
     <li> The exam is based on what we did in the lectures, the lab sessions,
      and the coursework. </li>
    </ol>

     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 3:
    <ol>
     <li> Monday (13/10/2014):
      <ol>
       <li> First we complete the lecture from last Friday. </li>
       <li> Then we look at the program "IntOps" in detail (
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOps.java">here</a> is
        the code). </li>
       <li> There are many problems with this program, and we try to write a
        "perfect" version of it. </li>
       <li> We learn:
        <ol>
         <li> <code>final</code> for declaring constants: Don't use
          <pre>
    int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
          </pre>
          but
          <pre>
    final int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
          </pre>
          for a variable whose value shouldn't be changed anymore (i.e., we
          have a <strong>constant</strong>).
         </li>
         <li> The <code>length</code>-variable to be used with
          <code>args</code> for finding out how many command-line arguments
          were entered:
          <pre>
args.length
          </pre>
          is an integer, namely the number of command-line arguments.
         </li>
         <li> <code>if</code> for conditional execution: Via
          <pre>
if (args.length &lt;= 1)
  System.err.println("ERROR[IntOpsI]: Two arguments are needed (two numbers).");
else
  ...
          </pre>
          we output an error-message in case we do not have two command-line
          arguments.
         </li>
         <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOpsI.java">Here</a>
          is the improved version. </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> The following material is for more advanced students,
        while if you are new to programming, then leave it for later. </li>
       <li> There are further serious problems with input handling:
        overflow and non-integer input. They can be handled using the
        following constructions.
        <ol>
         <li> <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code> and
          <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> for finding out the range of int's.
         </li>
         <li> <code>try ... catch</code> for error handling via catching
          exceptions. </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> Finally we have problems with the structure of the code: too
        many nested if-then-else make the code messy, and it would be good
        if we had also conditional variable initialisation:
        <ol>
         <li> The <code>System.exit</code> function allows early return with
          an exit-code. </li>
         <li> Conditional expressions allow to have several cases in the
          initialisation of variables. </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOpsP.java">Here</a>
        is the fully improved version. </li>

       </li>
       <li> This session completes the part on the basics of programming

       </li>
       <li> In the remainder of the module we will accelerate the speed. </li>
       <li> First
	<a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">ShowArgs.java</a> is
	a little program helping you to understand the array of strings
	<code>args</code>, and how it gets its value; understand the
	following:
	<pre>
> java ShowArgs jj k ll "  b n " \"
[Ljava.lang.String;@3ce53108
5
0 : "jj"
1 : "k"
2 : "ll"
3 : "  b n "
4 : """
       </pre>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">RandomSeq.java</a>
        is a simple example programs which outputs N (pseudo)random numbers
        to standard output.
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">Average.java</a>
        shows how to read an arbitrary stream of numbers from standard
        input and computing their arithmetic mean.
       </li>
       <li> This program is improved over the book version by
        <ul>
         <li> using more expressive code, </li>
         <li> checking for empty inputs, </li>
         <li> handling of input errors, </li>
         <li> and also allowing "arbitrarily" long input sequences (for all
          practical purposes). </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">PlotFilter.java</a> reads
         (all from standard input)
        <ol>
         <li> first four floating-point numbers for min x/y-values and max
          x/y-values, </li>
         <li> and then an arbitrary sequence of points, specified by their
          x,y coordinates (as floating-point numbers), </li>
        </ol>
        drawing each point when read.
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">SinFunction.java</a> plots
         the function sin(4x)+sin(20x) for 0 &lt;= x &lt;= pi.
        <ol>
         <li> Have a look at the error handling, which uses error-code
         constants specified at class-level. </li>
         <li> Note also that the constants "4" and "20" are not hard-coded.
         </li>
         <li> The command-line argument N is the number of points except the
          first point, used to plot the function by connecting them. </li>
         <li> If N is not large enough, then the output can be very misleading.

   <li> Week 8:
    <ol>
     <li> Monday (17/11/2014):
      <ol>
       <li> First an exercise for writing functions; write class
        "SimpleBernoulli" containing the following functions:
        <ol>
         <li> Function "bernoulli", taking a floating-point number p from 0 to
          1 as argument, and returning a boolean which is true with
          (pseudo-)probability p. </li>
         <li> Function "bernoulli_r", taking as arguments p as above and N, an
          integer, performing N random coin flips, and returning the number of
          heads. </li>
        </ol>
        The main program reads N and p from the command-line, and prints
        the result of bernoulli_r(p,N). How many coin-flips can be performed
        within a few seconds?
        <p></p>
        Here is the
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Section2/SimpleBernoulli.java">
         solution
        </a>.
       </li>
       <li> Now come exercises for using libraries
        <a href="Slides/22library-2x2.pdf"> Libraries and Clients </a>.
        Three programs have to be completed, filling the positions marked
        with "XXX", and one program has to be written from scratch.
        <ol>
         <li> Write a program <code>Statistics</code>, taking a list of
           floating-point numbers as arguments and printing their count,
           their minimum and maximum, their sum, and their average, each on a
           new line. Use the library StdStats.
          <p></p>
          Here is the
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Section2/Statistics.java">
         solution
        </a>. By the way, that's easy, but it has also disadvantages, namely?
         </li>
         <li> Using StdRandom.discrete:
          <ul>
           <li>

           </li>
           <li> Complete function "count" which
            <ul>
             <li> takes an array a of probabilities (as does
              StdRandom.discrete) and an integer N as arguments, </li>
             <li> performs N (pseudo-)random draws of natural numbers
              0, ..., a.length-1 according to the probabilities in
              a, </li>
             <li> counts for each of these natural number how often they occur,
             </li>
            </ul>
            and returns an array with these counts. </li>
           <li> Complete function "output". </li>
           <li> Run the program with some N, so that executions takes a few
            seconds. </li>

     <li> Monday (1/12/2014):
      <ol>
       <li> Discussing the solution of the first coursework. </li>
       <li> Understanding <code>null</code>, and Java-Objects in general:
        <ol>
         <li> An "object" in Java is a special thing. Therefore I refer to it
          as "Java-object". </li>
         <li> Objects of primitive data type (int's, boolean's, double's,
          char's, and some more) are <strong>NOT</strong> Java-objects. </li>
         <li> The speciality of Java-objects is that, unlike int's for
          example, you never have them "in your hands" --- only
          <strong>pointers</strong>. </li>
         <li> A variable for a Java-object is a <strong>pointer</strong>. </li>
         <li> That is, it is a memory address! </li>
         <li> There is a special exceptional ("singular") memory address,
          namely "null", which stands for something which is NOT THERE. </li>
         <li> Study the demo-program
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/NullString.java">
           NullString
          </a> carefully! </li>

   <li> Week 11:
    <ol>
     <li> Monday (8/12/2014): Issues with Java-objects
      <ol>
       <li> "Identity" and "Equality": All the issues are demonstrated in
        program
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/EqualityIssues.java">
         EqualityIssues
        </a> --- predict its output!
       </li>
       <li> Understanding "pass-by-value" and "pass-by-reference":
        <ol>
         <li> What is the output of
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/PassByValue.java">
           PassByValue
          </a> ? </li>
         <li> And which of the variables (arguments of function
          <code>update</code> and others) can be made final?
          The solution is provided
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/PassByValue2.java">
           here
          </a>.
         </li>
         <li> Aliasing:
          <ol>
           <li> What is the output of
            <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/PotentialProblem.java">
             PotentialProblem
            </a> ? </li>
           <li> What is the output of
            <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/PotentialProblem2.java">
             PotentialProblem2
            </a> ? </li>
           <li> What is the output of
            <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/PotentialProblem3.java">
             PotentialProblem3
            </a> ? </li>
          </ol>
          Understand that aliasing can not occur in the first two examples,
          whatever we do, since the data types used for variable x are
          immutable. And understand why using a "proper class", i.e.,
          an array here, provided the additional level of indirection in the
          third example so that aliasing finally occurs.

  <h2> Exercise lab sessions </h2>

  <p>
   Remark: If some answer is already given, then <em>understand</em> why
   this is the correct answer.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li> Week 2 (10/10/2014):
    <ol>
     <li> The program "UseArgument.java" from the book is needed:
      <ol>
       <li> If you have already written it, rewrite it
        <strong>from scratch</strong>, not using notes! </li>
       <li> Otherwise you find it above (material for Lectures Week 2): enter
        it and understand it. </li>
       <li> It is called with, e.g.,
        <pre>
> java UseArgument X Y Z
        </pre>
  and it outputs
        <pre>
Hello, X, Y, Z!
        </pre>
       </li>
       <li> It's really important that you get the syntax into your fingers.
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Do the Exercises from Section 1.1 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/11hello/"> here </a> at the
      bottom, Exercises 1 - 5).
     </li>
     <li> If you wish to prepare for the lecture (otherwise, do this exercise
      later!), enter the program
      <pre>
public class LeftAssociative {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    final int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    final int b = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
    System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + a + b); // not what is meant
    System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + (a + b));
    System.out.println(a + b + " + " + "13" + " = " + (a + b + 13)); // understand this
  }
}
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> Play around with it, and understand what it is doing. </li>
     <li> The key is to understand that we have variables of two types,
      <code>int</code> and <code>String</code>, and that automatic conversions
      are performed from <code>int</code> to <code>String</code> if needed.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 3 (17/10/2014):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider the exercises from Section 1.2 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/12types/"> here </a>
      after the "Q + A" section, Exercises 1 - 23).
      <ul>
       <li> Exercises 1.2.1 - 1.2.14 are about understanding expressions.
       </li>
       <li> Write little programs which compute the expressions, possibly
        for all inputs (especially in the case of boolean expressions).
       </li>
       <li> If you wish to write a new program, consider 1.2.14 - 1.2.23.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> If you wish to prepare for the lecture, enter the three programs from
      the lecture/book (Flip, PowersOfTwo, Sqrt), run them with all sorts of
      different arguments, understand the outcome. </li>
     <li> Especially try to <em>crash</em> the programs (missing or
      strange inputs, very large or very small numbers, ...). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 4 (24/10/2014):
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program which reads two integers and prints them out sorted
      in ascending order. </li>
     <li> Write another program which reads three integers and prints them
      out sorted in ascending order. </li>
     <li> Write better versions of "TenHellos.java" (printing "Hello World!"
      ten times), using first a while-loop and then a for-loop. Which
      is better? </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.3.1 - 1.3.7 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>);
      perhaps first considering exercises 1, 3, 4 (perhaps writing a complete
      program), 6 (again perhaps writing programs to testing your answer)
      and 7. </li>
    </ol>
    See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Week00_Thursday"> here </a>
    for solutions. Additional exercises:
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the sum
      1 + 2 + ... + N. </li>
     <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the product
      1 * 2 * ... * N; choose a suitable data type so that some interesting
      computations can be performed! </li>
     <li> Enter the program "Gambler" from the lecture, and play around with
      it a bit. </li>
     <li> Improve the output of "Gambler":
      <ul>
       <li> Print out the inputs, with additional explanations. </li>
       <li> Print out the frequency wins/T (where T is the number of
        trials). </li>
       <li> Print out the probability stake/goal of winning. </li>
       <li> Print out the expected number of steps (stake)*(goal-stake).
       </li>
       <li> Finally determine the average and the maximum number of steps
        it took to finish a trial (that is, the number of steps until cash
        either is 0 or goal), and print it out. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.3.8 - 1.3.31 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>). </li>
    </ol>
    See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Week00_Friday"> here </a>
    for solutions.
   </li>
   <li> Week 5 (31/10/2014):
    <a name="ExercisesWeek05"></a>
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program "Deck32" (recall "Deck"), which uses only a deck of
      32 cards, where the ranks do not include 2 up to 6. </li>
     <li> Now combine "Deck" and "Deck32" into one program, where via a
      command-line argument it is decided whether 32 or 52 cards are to be
      used. </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.4.1 - 1.4.9 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.4.35 from the book ("Birthday.java", see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 6 (7/11/2014):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.5.1 - 1.5.3 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/15inout/"> here</a>):
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program that reads in integers (as many as the user
        enters) from standard input and prints out the maximum and minimum
        values. Before entering the program, make a sketch on paper. </li>
       <li> Modify this program by rejecting non-positive entries, asking the
        user to re-enter the input (until he gets it correct). Before
       entering the program, extend the previous sketch. Hint: a while-loop
       is appropriate for testing the input values.</li>
       <li> Read N from the command-line and N floating-point number from
        standard input, and compute their mean value. Create an error message
        if not enough numbers were entered. Compute also the standard
        deviation as the square root of the sum of the squares of the
        differences from these numbers and the average, the whole then divided
        by N-1. Hint: For this computation you could store the numbers in
        an array. </li>
      </ol>
      Always test your programs thoroughly!
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.5.7 from the book: Read in N from the
      command-line plus N-1 integers from 1 to N from standard input, assuming
      that these numbers are different. Now determine the missing number (from
      the interval 1 .. N). </li>
     <li> As an additional exercise, improve
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">PlotFilter.java</a>
      by not asking for the minimum x/y values, but computing them from
      the input (so the first four special doubles from standard input are not
      needed anymore). Test with
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">USA.txt</a>, where you
      removed the first four numbers.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 7 (14/11/2014):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.1 - 2.1.4 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> As additional exercises you can consider 2.1.13, 2.1.14 and 2.1.17.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 8 (21/11/2014):
    <ol>
     <li> If you didn't finish the exercises from last week, then please
      finish them now (we are still on functions). </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.5, 2.1.12, 2.1.18, 2.1.19 and 2.1.20
      from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> For exercise 2.1.18, if for example the input is the array
      (1,3,7), then the output should be (0,3/7,1). And if the
      input is (-10,-4,-1), then the output should be (0,6/9,1).
     </li>
     <li> Additional exercises on multidimensional arrays:
      <ol>
       <li> Hard-code a 3 x 3 array of integers with the values
        <pre>
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
        </pre>
        and print it out. </li>
       <li> Write a function <code>print_array(A)</code> in a class
        <code>PrintArray</code> which prints out an arbitrary two-dimensional
        array of integers, row-wise. Handle the general case, where every row
        can have a different length. And if null-pointers occur for a row
        , then print "[null]", while if the whole array is null, then print
        "[[null]]" (no exceptions should be thrown). </li>
       <li> Add a main function to class <code>PrintArray</code> which tests
        function <code>print_array(A)</code>. </li>
       <li> Read natural numbers M and N from the command
        line, specifying an M x N array of integers. Then read from standard
        input (using <code>StdIn</code>) row-wise these M*N many integers,
        and store them in an array. Finally print them out, using
        <code>PrintArray.print_array</code>. </li>
      </ol>
      See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/ArrayExercises">here</a> for
      solutions.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 9 (28/11/2014):
    <ol>
     <li> See the two exercises above
     (writing programs <code>AlbersSquares</code> and <code>Grayscale</code>).
     </li>
     <li> Further exercises using the data types "Color" and "Picture" from
      the lecture (see above):
      <ol>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.2 from the book: Write a program that takes from the
        command-line three integers from 0 to 255 (representing red, green
        and blue), and then creates and shows a 256-by-256 picture of that
        colour. </li>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.3 from the book: Modify program "AlbersSquares" to
        take nine command-line arguments, representing now three colours, and
        then draw the 3*2=6 squares showing all the Albers squares with the
        large square in each colour and the small square in each different
        colour. </li>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.6 from the book: Write a program that takes the name
        of a picture file as a command-line input, and creates three images,
        one that contains only the red components, one for green, and one for
        blue. </li>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.4 from the book:
        <ul>
         <li> Write a program that takes the name of a grayscale picture-file
          as a command-line argument, and plots a histogram of the frequency
          of occurrences of each of the 256 grayscale intensities. </li>
         <li> Use the library "StdStats" from Section 2.2 (provided
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Libraries"> here </a>). </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Another (simple) array-exercises:
      <ol>
       <li> Read N from the command-line. </li>
       <li> Create an NxN array A of integers, where the first row contains
        0,1,..., the second row contains 1,2,..., and so on. </li>
       <li> Then add all the numbers on the principal diagonal (that is,
        A[0,0] + A[1,1] + ...), and print out the result. </li>
       <li> You can easily check whether your program works: the result should
        be N*(N-1). </li>
       <li> Use one function for creating the array. </li>
       <li> And use another function for computing the diagonal sum. </li>
      </ol>
      The solution is
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/ArrayExercises/DiagonalSum.java">
       here
      </a>.
     </li>
     <li> Finally we practise using static data members ("static instance
      variables"). Write a class <code>StringExample</code>:
      <ul>
        <li> Containing (static) constants <code>size_a</code> of
        value 4 and array <code>a</code> containing the four strings "AB",
        "XYZ", "EFG", "1234". </li>
        <li> We also have <code>size_b</code> of value 3, and array
         <code>b</code> containing the three strings "M1", "T3", "y6". </li>
       <li> Furthermore we have a static function <code>check_a</code> which
        takes one string argument x, and returns integers from 0 to 3 if the
        string x occurs in array <code>a</code> with that index, while
        otherwise -1 is returned. </li>
       <li> And in the same vein we have <code>check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> Both functions must use a loop for checking the membership in the
        respective array. </li>
       <li> The main programs reads pairs of strings from standard input (as
        long as standard input has not been closed), and prints out the results
        of <code>check_a, check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> For example "EFG T3" results in "2 1", and "X y6" results in
        "-1 2". </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/StringExample.java">
       the solution </a>.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 10 (5/12/2014):
    <ol>
     <li> For example via
      <pre>
int[] a = null;
System.out.println(a);
      </pre>
      we can see an array-object whose value is <code>null</code>.
      Can you create an array-object with value <code>null</code> without
      explicitly assigning <code>null</code>? Study the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week10/ArrayNull.java"> solution </a>.
     </li>
     <li> On "length":
      <ol>
       <li> What is the technical reason that one uses <code>a.length</code>
        for an array, but <code>s.length()</code> for a string? </li>
       <li> Could there be an underlying design-reason? </li>
       <li> See
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week10/Length.java"> here </a>
        for some demonstration.
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Creating and using a trivial class:
      <ul>
       <li> Write a class <code>Trivial</code>, which stores two integers (via
        the constructor), and as member functions ("methods") allows to
        compute their sum and to translate the object into a string. </li>
       <li> Write then a program which reads four integers from the
        command-line, creates two objects of type <code>Trivial</code>
        accordingly, and outputs their sums and the objects themselves. </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Trivial.java">
       the Trivial-solution </a>, and here is the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Client.java"> Client </a>.
     </li>
     <li> Study "Charge.java" and "Potential.java", understand how it works,
      and play a bit around (using for example "charges.txt" as input). </li>
     <li> Study <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Libraries/Turtle.java">
       Turtle.java </a> and the application
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/Spiral.java">Spiral.java </a>;
      play a bit around with it, and write your own clients of class Turtle,
      creating some simple turtle-graphics. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Additional exercises:
    <ul>
     <li> More on arrays (and static functions):
      <ol>
       <li> Counting random events:
        <ol>
         <li> Write a program (class) "RandomNumbers" which takes two
          command-line arguments M and N. </li>
         <li> The program then creates N many random integers in the interval
          [1, M], counts how often each of these integers occurs, and then
          prints out the relative frequency for each of these M numbers (that is,
          the quotient "occurrences / N"). </li>
         <li> Your program should work for large N, and thus should not store
          the N random numbers computed. </li>
         <li> For the creation of the random integer write a function
          <code>random(M)</code>, which takes M as parameter, and returns a
          random integer from 1 to M. </li>
         <li> Hint: you need to use an integer-array of size M for performing
          the counting. </li>
        </ol>
        Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/RandomNumbers.java">
         the solution </a>.
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> More on modules (or "libraries"):
      <ol>
       <li> Implement the library class StdStats with (just) the static
        functions "min", "max" and "mean". </li>
       <li> Write a program "Stats" which is called with floating point
        numbers as command-line parameters, and which computes their
        minimum, maximum and average, using your library StdStats. </li>
       <li> For example, "Stats 4 5.2" would yield min=4, max=5.2,
        mean=4.6. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Parsing strings (using methods from the <code>String</code> class)
      <ol>
       <li> Read a string from the command-line and determine how many
        space-separated parts it has.
        <ul>
         <li> Call the class "CountParts", printing out how many parts there
          are. </li>
         <li> In order to input a string containing spaces, you need to use
          single quotation marks, e.g.
          <pre>
> java CountParts 'hhg   j bbnbh bvc c'
5
          </pre>
         </li>
         <li> This task is very easy using the split-method of the String-class;
          see Section 3.1 of the book (also available
          <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/31datatype/"> here </a>).
         </li>
         <li> Examples for the split-functions are
          <a href="http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0438.html"> there
          </a>.
         </li>
         <li> Play around with various inputs (only spaces, leading spaces,
          trailing spaces, ...), to better understand the behaviour. </li>
         <li> Here is a
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/CountParts.java">
           solution </a>
          which also shows the parts with their indices.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li> Modify the solution of the previous part, where now the string is
        split at the symbol "@".
        <ul>
         <li> Again, play around with it (what happens when spaces are used?).
         </li>
         <li> Here is a
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/SplitCharacter.java">
           solution </a>
          which again shows the parts with their indices.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li> Parse a string, where you extract all digits from it, adding them
        up, returning their sum and the original string without these digits:
        <ul>
         <li> For example
          <pre>
> java Crossfoot 'dg08 ha ns82g40h1 '
23
"dg ha nsgh "
          </pre>
         </li>
         <li> To detect whether a character is a digit, use that characters
          are treated as integers, and thus can be compared by "&lt;" etc., and
          can be added/subtracted. </li>
         <li> Here is a
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/Crossfoot.java">
           solution </a>.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Recursion (we didn't do that section from Chapter 2):
      <ol>
       <li> Enter the program "Htree" from the book. </li>
       <li> Write a modified program "Htree2", which asks for confirmation
        before continuing drawing parts of the tree. </li>
       <li> Also print out appropriate messages, so that you can follow in
        detail the recursion. </li>
       <li> Run the program for inputs up to 4, and make sure you understand
        what's going on! </li>
      </ol>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Section3/Htree2.java">
       a solution </a>.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> Coursework </h2>

  <h3> First coursework </h3>

  <ul>
   <li> Available on <a href="https://blackboard.swan.ac.uk/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp">Blackboard</a>. </li>
   <li> Deadline for submission is Monday 10/11/2014, 11:00. </li>
   <li> See <a href="Debugging.html">Debugging notes</a> for some help on how
    to handle syntax- and runtime-errors. </li>
   <li> You will obtain a personal e-mail with comments on your program and
    your mark (explained). </li>
   <li> There will be a solution provided. </li>
<!--
   <li> There are also files "TestcasesXXX", which contain on one line the
    command-line parameters, and on the next line the expected output.
   </li>
-->
  </ul>


  <h3> Second coursework </h3>

  <ul>
   <li> Deadline for submission is Wednesday 10/12/2014, 11:00. </li>
   <li> The file "Comments.txt" must start with name and student number
    of the authors (one or two), and can then contain any comments or
    explanations you might want to make.
   </li>
   <li> Good coding quality is paramount:
    <ol>
     <li> You must have tested your code (compiled it and run it).
     </li>
     <li> Syntax errors will result in deductions. </li>
     <li> This time there is no output at all. </li>
     <li> Use only the Java constructions presented in the lectures.
      <ul>
       <li> Anything else will result in a deduction of 50 percent! (The same
        will hold for the second coursework.) </li>
       <li> This is to make sure that you really concentrate on the essentials,
        and don't copy-and-paste code (which usually contains a lot of noise).
       </li>
       <li> Thus under no circumstances an "import"-statement can be used.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Compared to the book, we introduced the
      <code>final</code>-qualifier, which you are expected to use. </li>
     <li> Take care about precise class- and file-names. </li>
     <li> Care about <em>private</em> and <em>public</em>. </li>
     <li> Use private helper-functions (methods). </li>
     <li> Choose good variable-names. </li>
     <li> Provide a well-organised indentation. </li>
     <li> There should be no tab-symbols in your file, and no trailing spaces.
     </li>
     <li> There shouldn't be non-ASCII symbols in your files. </li>
     <li> No comments are allowed in the code: write good
      code, so that no comments are needed! </li>
     <li> Finally, follow <strong>precisely</strong> the specification. </li>
     <li> Additionally to the first coursework, now also the
      function-signatures (name, parameter-types and return-type) are part of
      the specification, so no deviation is allowed. </li>
     <li> If you use additional functions, make them private (they do not
      belong to the published interface). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The programs must not contain any comments (so that you can
    concentrate on the code). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
<!--
   <li> There are also files "TestcasesXXX", which contain on one line the
    command-line parameters, and on the next line the expected output.
   </li>
-->
