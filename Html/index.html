  <h1>CS-M41 Programming in Java 2013/14</h1>


  <h2> Messages </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> See below for the first coursework (with further explanations on
    how to submit). </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> General information </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> First week (30/9/2013 - 4/10/2013):
    <ol>
     <li> One lab session Tuesday 9:00 - 10:00 in the Linux lab (room 217).
      <ol>
       <li> This is a short session. </li>
       <li> The main task is to get used to the environment (knowing your
        password, etc.). </li>
       <li> Tasks:
        <ul>
         <li> Check that your login works. </li>
         <li> Access the course home page, and store the link. </li>
         <li> Browse the course home page, and get a bit familiar with it.
         </li>
         <li> Buy the book. </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Support session Thursday 16:00 - 17:00 in the Linux lab (room 217).
      If you have some problems, please come (otherwise you don't need to
      come). </li>
     <li> One lecture Friday 11:00 - 12:00 in the Robert Recorde room. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> From 7/10/2013 to 6/12/2013:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday, 9:00 - 11:00, "support lab" session in the Linux lab
      (room 217). </li>
     <li> Thursday 16:00 - 17:00, "exercise lab" session (Linux lab). </li>
     <li> Friday, 11:00 - 12:00, lecture in the Robert Recorde room.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the <strong>support lab sessions</strong>:
    <ol>
     <li> In the support lab sessions a mixture of teaching and programming
      practice takes place. </li>
     <li> We might not make use of all support lab sessions. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the <strong>exercise lab sessions</strong>:
    <ol>
     <li> Active participation in all exercise lab session is awarded 10% of
      the overall module marks. </li>
     <li> For each exercise lab sessions tasks are distributed. </li>
     <li> During the exercise lab session, work on these tasks is expected.
     </li>
     <li> "Active participation" means that during the whole lab session
      reasonable work related to the module is performed, typically related
      to the current tasks, but possibly also related to previous tasks,
      or to other questions or problems (of course, related to the module).
     </li>
     <li> There are no tests (or exams) in the labs. Every student present for
      the full time and doing reasonable work gets acknowledged his/her
      active participation. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Assessment:
    <ol>
     <li> 10% is allocated to active participation in the exercise lab
      sessions. </li>
     <li> Two courseworks are handed out, each worth 20%. </li>
     <li> The remaining 50% is the January exam. </li>
     <li> The exam is based on what we did in the lectures, the lab sessions,
      and the coursework. </li>
    </ol>

     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 3:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday (15/10/2013):
      <ol>
       <li> First we complete the lecture from last Friday. </li>
       <li> Then we look at the program "IntOps" in detail (
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOps.java">here</a> is
        the code). </li>
       <li> There are many problems with this program, and we try to write a
        "perfect" version of it. </li>
       <li> We learn:
        <ol>
         <li> <code>final</code> for declaring constants: Don't use
          <pre>
    int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
          </pre>
          but
          <pre>
    final int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
          </pre>
          for a variable whose value shouldn't be changed anymore (i.e., we
          have a <strong>constant</strong>).
         </li>
         <li> The <code>length</code>-variable to be used with
          <code>args</code> for finding out how many command-line arguments
          were entered:
          <pre>
args.length
          </pre>
          is an integer, namely the number of command-line arguments.
         </li>
         <li> <code>if</code> for conditional execution: Via
          <pre>
if (args.length &lt;= 1)
  System.err.println("ERROR[IntOpsI]: Two arguments are needed (two numbers).");
else
  ...
          </pre>
          we output an error-message in case we do not have two command-line
          arguments.
         </li>
         <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOpsI.java">Here</a>
          is the improved version. </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> The following material is for more advanced students,
        while if you are new to programming, then leave it for later. </li>
       <li> There are further serious problems with input handling:
        overflow and non-integer input. They can be handled using the
        following constructions.
        <ol>
         <li> <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code> and
          <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> for finding out the range of int's.
         </li>
         <li> <code>try ... catch</code> for error handling via catching
          exceptions. </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> Finally we have problems with the structure of the code: too
        many nested if-then-else make the code messy, and it would be good
        if we had also conditional variable initialisation:
        <ol>
         <li> The <code>System.exit</code> function allows early return with
          an exit-code. </li>
         <li> Conditional expressions allow to have several cases in the
          initialisation of variables. </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOpsP.java">Here</a>
        is the fully improved version. </li>
	</ol>

       </li>
       <li> Please enter all programs (still) by hand (no copy-and-paste).
       </li>
       <li> This session completes the part on the basics of programming
        (variables, expressions, basic types, loops, conditions, arrays).
       </li>
       <li> In the remainder of the module we will accelerate the speed. </li>
       <li> First
	<a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">ShowArgs.java</a> is
	a little program helping you to understand the array of strings
	<code>args</code>, and how it gets its value; understand the
	following:
	<pre>
> java ShowArgs jj k ll "  b n " \"
[Ljava.lang.String;@3ce53108
5
0 : "jj"
1 : "k"
2 : "ll"
3 : "  b n "
4 : """
       </pre>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">RandomSeq.java</a>
        is a simple example programs which outputs N (pseudo)random numbers
        to standard output.
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">Average.java</a>
        shows how to read an arbitrary stream of numbers from standard
        input and computing their arithmetic mean.
       </li>
       <li> This program is improved over the book version by
        <ul>
         <li> using more expressive code, </li>
         <li> checking for empty inputs, </li>
         <li> handling of input errors, </li>
         <li> and also allowing "arbitrarily" long input sequences (for all
          practical purposes). </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">PlotFilter.java</a> reads
         (all from standard input)
        <ol>
         <li> first four floating-point numbers for min x/y-values and max
          x/y-values, </li>
         <li> and then an arbitrary sequence of points, specified by their
          x,y coordinates (as floating-point numbers), </li>
        </ol>
        drawing each point when read.
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">SinFunction.java</a> plots
         the function sin(4x)+sin(20x) for 0 &lt;= x &lt;= pi.
        <ol>
         <li> Have a look at the error handling, which uses error-code
         constants specified at class-level. </li>
         <li> Note also that the constants "4" and "20" are not hard-coded.
         </li>
         <li> The command-line argument N is the number of points except the
          first point, used to plot the function by connecting them. </li>
         <li> If N is not large enough, then the output can be very misleading.

   <li> Week 8:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday (19/11/2013):
      <ol>
       <li> First an exercise for writing functions; write class
        "SimpleBernoulli" containing the following functions:
        <ol>
         <li> Function "bernoulli", taking a floating-point number p from 0 to
          1 as argument, and returning a boolean which is true with
          (pseudo-)probability p. </li>
         <li> Function "bernoulli_r", taking as arguments p as above and N, an
          integer, performing N random coin flips, and returning the number of
          heads. </li>
        </ol>
        The main program reads N and p from the command-line, and prints
        the result of bernoulli_r(p,N). How many coin-flips can be performed
        within a few seconds?
        <p></p>
        Here is the
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Section2/SimpleBernoulli.java">
         solution
        </a>.
       </li>
       <li> Now come exercises for using libraries
        <a href="Slides/22library-2x2.pdf"> Libraries and Clients </a>.
        Three programs have to be completed, filling the positions marked
        with "XXX", and one program has to be written from scratch.
        <ol>
         <li> Solve the first exercise from Coursework I, now using the library
          StdStats.
          <p></p>
          Here is the
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Section2/Statistics.java">
         solution
        </a>. By the way, that's easy, but it has also disadvantages, namely?
         </li>
         <li> Using StdRandom.discrete:
          <ul>
           <li>

           <li> Complete function "count" which
            <ul>
             <li> takes an array a of probabilities (as does
              StdRandom.discrete) and an integer N as arguments, </li>
             <li> performs N (pseudo-)random draws of natural numbers
              0, ..., a.length-1 according to the probabilities in
              a, </li>
             <li> counts for each of these natural number how often they occur,
             </li>
            </ul>
            and returns an array with these counts. </li>
           <li> Complete function "output". </li>
           <li> Run the program with some N, so that executions takes a few
            seconds. </li>

     <li> Tuesday (3/12/2013):
      <ol>
       <li> Discussing the solution of the first coursework. </li>
       <li> Understanding <code>null</code>, and Java-Objects in general:
        <ol>
         <li> An "object" in Java is a special thing. Therefore I refer to it
          as "Java-object". </li>
         <li> Objects of primitive data type (int's, boolean's, double's,
          char's, and some more) are <strong>NOT</strong> Java-objects. </li>
         <li> The speciality of Java-objects is that, unlike int's for
          example, you never have them "in your hands" --- only
          <strong>pointers</strong>. </li>
         <li> A variable for a Java-object is a <strong>pointer</strong>. </li>
         <li> That is, it is a memory address! </li>
         <li> There is a special exceptional ("singular") memory address,
          namely "null", which stands for something which is NOT THERE. </li>
         <li> Study the demo-program
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/NullString.java">
           NullString
          </a> carefully! </li>

   <li> Week 11:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday (10/12/2013): Issues with Java-objects
      <ol>
       <li> "Identity" and "Equality": All the issues are demonstrated in
        program
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/EqualityIssues.java">
         EqualityIssues
        </a> --- predict its output!
       </li>
       <li> Understanding "pass-by-value" and "pass-by-reference":
        <ol>
         <li> What is the output of
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/PassByValue.java">
           PassByValue
          </a> ? </li>
         <li> And which of the variables (arguments of function
          <code>update</code> and others) can be made final?
          The solution is provided
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/PassByValue2.java">
           here
          </a>.
         </li>
         <li> Aliasing:
          <ol>
           <li> What is the output of
            <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/PotentialProblem.java">
             PotentialProblem
            </a> ? </li>
           <li> What is the output of
            <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/PotentialProblem2.java">
             PotentialProblem2
            </a> ? </li>
           <li> What is the output of
            <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/PotentialProblem3.java">
             PotentialProblem3
            </a> ? </li>
          </ol>
          Understand that aliasing can not occur in the first two examples,
          whatever we do, since the data types used for variable x are
          immutable. And understand why using a "proper class", i.e.,
          an array here, provided the additional level of indirection in the
          third example so that aliasing finally occurs.

   Remark: If some answer is already given, then <em>understand</em> why
   this is the correct answer.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li> Week 2 (10/10/2013):
    <ol>
     <li> The program "UseArgument.java" from the book is needed again ---
      rewrite it <strong>from scratch</strong>, not using notes!
      <ol>
       <li> Recall that it is called with, e.g.,
        <pre>
> java UseArgument XYZ
        </pre>
  and it outputs
  <pre>
Hi, XYZ. How are you?
        </pre>
       </li>
       <li> It's really important that you get the syntax into your fingers.
       </li>
       <li> If you get stuck, then have a <em>tiny</em> little glimpse into
        the book, just to help you to continue. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Do the Exercises from Section 1.1 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/11hello/"> here </a> at the
      bottom, Exercises 1 - 5).
     </li>
     <li> Enter the program
      <pre>
public class LeftAssociative {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    final int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    final int b = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
    System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + a + b); // not what is meant
    System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + (a + b));
    System.out.println(a + b + " + " + "13" + " = " + (a + b + 13)); // understand this
  }
}
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> Play around with it, and understand what it is doing. </li>
     <li> The key is to understand that we have variables of two types,
      <code>int</code> and <code>String</code>, and that automatic conversions
      are performed from <code>int</code> to <code>String</code> if needed.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 3 (17/10/2013):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider the exercises from Section 1.2 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/12types/"> here </a>
      after the "Q + A" section, Exercises 1 - 23).
      <ul>
       <li> Exercises 1.2.1 - 1.2.14 are about understanding expressions.
       </li>
       <li> Write little programs which compute the expressions, possibly
        for all inputs (especially in the case of boolean expressions).
       </li>
       <li> If you wish to write a new program, consider 1.2.14 - 1.2.23.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> If you wish to prepare for tomorrow, enter the three programs from
      the lecture/book (Flip, PowersOfTwo, Sqrt), run them with all sorts of
      different arguments, understand the outcome. </li>
     <li> Especially try to <em>crash</em> the programs (missing or
      strange inputs, very large or very small numbers, ...). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 4 (24/10/2013):
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program which reads two integers and prints them out sorted
      in ascending order. </li>
     <li> Write another program which reads three integers and prints them
      out sorted in ascending order. </li>
     <li> Write better versions of "TenHellos.java" (printing "Hello World!"
      ten times), using first a while-loop and then a for-loop. Which
      is better? </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.3.1 - 1.3.7 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>);
      perhaps first considering exercises 1, 3, 4 (perhaps writing a complete
      program), 6 (again perhaps writing programs to testing your answer)
      and 7. </li>
    </ol>
    See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Week00_Thursday"> here </a>
    for solutions. Additional exercises:
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the sum
      1 + 2 + ... + N. </li>
     <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the product
      1 * 2 * ... * N; choose a suitable data type so that some interesting
      computations can be performed! </li>
     <li> Enter the program "Gambler" from the lecture, and play around with
      it a bit. </li>
     <li> Improve the output of "Gambler":
      <ul>
       <li> Print out the inputs, with additional explanations. </li>
       <li> Print out the frequency wins/T (where T is the number of
        trials). </li>
       <li> Print out the probability stake/goal of winning. </li>
       <li> Print out the expected number of steps (stake)*(goal-stake).
       </li>
       <li> Finally determine the average and the maximum number of steps
        it took to finish a trial (that is, the number of steps until cash
        either is 0 or goal), and print it out. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.3.8 - 1.3.31 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>). </li>
    </ol>
    See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Week00_Friday"> here </a>
    for solutions.
   </li>
   <li> Week 5 (31/10/2013):
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program "Deck32" (recall "Deck"), which uses only a deck of
      32 cards, where the ranks do not include 2 up to 6. </li>
     <li> Now combine "Deck" and "Deck32" into one program, where via a
      command-line argument it is decided whether 32 or 52 cards are to be
      used. </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.4.1 - 1.4.9 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.4.35 from the book ("Birthday.java", see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 6 (7/11/2013):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.5.1 - 1.5.3 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/15inout/"> here</a>):
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program that reads in integers (as many as the user
        enters) from standard input and prints out the maximum and minimum
        values. Before entering the program, make a sketch on paper. </li>
       <li> Modify this program by rejecting non-positive entries, asking the
        user to re-enter the input (until he gets it correct). Before
       entering the program, extend the previous sketch. Hint: a while-loop
       is appropriate for testing the input values.</li>
       <li> Read N from the command-line and N floating-point number from
        standard input, and compute their mean value. Create an error message
        if not enough numbers were entered. Compute also the standard
        deviation as the square root of the sum of the squares of the
        differences from these numbers and the average, the whole then divided
        by N-1. Hint: For this computation you could store the numbers in
        an array. </li>
      </ol>
      Always test your programs thoroughly!
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.5.7 from the book: Read in N from the
      command-line plus N-1 integers from 1 to N from standard input, assuming
      that these numbers are different. Now determine the missing number (from
      the interval 1 .. N). </li>
     <li> As an additional exercise, improve
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">PlotFilter.java</a>
      by not asking for the minimum x/y values, but computing them from
      the input (so the first four special doubles from standard input are not
      needed anymore). Test with
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">USA.txt</a>, where you
      removed the first four numbers.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 7 (14/11/2013):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.1 - 2.1.4 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> As additional exercises you can consider 2.1.13, 2.1.14 and 2.1.17.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 8 (21/11/2013):
    <ol>
     <li> If you didn't finish the exercises from last week, then please
      finish them now (we are still on functions). </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.5, 2.1.12, 2.1.18, 2.1.19 and 2.1.20
      from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> For exercise 2.1.18, if for example the input is the array
      (1,3,7), then the output should be (0,3/7,1). And if the
      input is (-10,-4,-1), then the output should be (0,6/9,1).
     </li>
     <li> Additional exercises on multidimensional arrays:
      <ol>
       <li> Hard-code a 3 x 3 array of integers with the values
        <pre>
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
        </pre>
        and print it out. </li>
       <li> Write a function <code>print_array(A)</code> in a class
        <code>PrintArray</code> which prints out an arbitrary two-dimensional
        array of integers, row-wise. Handle the general case, where every row
        can have a different length. And if null-pointers occur for a row
        , then print "[null]", while if the whole array is null, then print
        "[[null]]" (no exceptions should be thrown). </li>
       <li> Add a main function to class <code>PrintArray</code> which tests
        function <code>print_array(A)</code>. </li>
       <li> Read natural numbers M and N from the command
        line, specifying an M x N array of integers. Then read from standard
        input (using <code>StdIn</code>) row-wise these M*N many integers,
        and store them in an array. Finally print them out, using
        <code>PrintArray.print_array</code>. </li>
      </ol>
      See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/ArrayExercises">here</a> for
      solutions.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 9 (28/11/2013):
    <ol>
     <li> See the two exercises above for the Tuesday-lecture
     (writing programs <code>AlbersSquares</code> and <code>Grayscale</code>).
     </li>
     <li> Further exercises using the data types "Color" and "Picture" from
      the lecture (see above):
      <ol>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.2 from the book: Write a program that takes from the
        command-line three integers from 0 to 255 (representing red, green
        and blue), and then creates and shows a 256-by-256 picture of that
        colour. </li>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.3 from the book: Modify program "AlbersSquares" to
        take nine command-line arguments, representing now three colours, and
        then draw the 3*2=6 squares showing all the Albers squares with the
        large square in each colour and the small square in each different
        colour. </li>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.6 from the book: Write a program that takes the name
        of a picture file as a command-line input, and creates three images,
        one that contains only the red components, one for green, and one for
        blue. </li>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.4 from the book:
        <ul>
         <li> Write a program that takes the name of a grayscale picture-file
          as a command-line argument, and plots a histogram of the frequency
          of occurrences of each of the 256 grayscale intensities. </li>
         <li> Use the library "StdStats" from Section 2.2 (provided
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Libraries"> here </a>). </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Another (simple) array-exercises:
      <ol>
       <li> Read N from the command-line. </li>
       <li> Create an NxN array A of integers, where the first row contains
        0,1,..., the second row contains 1,2,..., and so on. </li>
       <li> Then add all the numbers on the principal diagonal (that is,
        A[0,0] + A[1,1] + ...), and print out the result. </li>
       <li> You can easily check whether your program works: the result should
        be N*(N-1). </li>
       <li> Use one function for creating the array. </li>
       <li> And use another function for computing the diagonal sum. </li>
      </ol>
      The solution is
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/ArrayExercises/DiagonalSum.java">
       here
      </a>.
     </li>
     <li> Finally we practise using static data members ("static instance
      variables"). Write a class <code>StringExample</code>:
      <ul>
        <li> Containing (static) constants <code>size_a</code> of
        value 4 and array <code>a</code> containing the four strings "AB",
        "XYZ", "EFG", "1234". </li>
        <li> We also have <code>size_b</code> of value 3, and array
         <code>b</code> containing the three strings "M1", "T3", "y6". </li>
       <li> Furthermore we have a static function <code>check_a</code> which
        takes one string argument x, and returns integers from 0 to 3 if the
        string x occurs in array <code>a</code> with that index, while
        otherwise -1 is returned. </li>
       <li> And in the same vein we have <code>check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> Both functions must use a loop for checking the membership in the
        respective array. </li>
       <li> The main programs reads pairs of strings from standard input (as
        long as standard input has not been closed), and prints out the results
        of <code>check_a, check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> For example "EFG T3" results in "2 1", and "X y6" results in
        "-1 2". </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/StringExample.java">
       the solution </a>.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 10 (5/12/2013):
    <ol>
     <li> For example via
      <pre>
int[] a = null;
System.out.println(a);
      </pre>
      we can see an array-object whose value is <code>null</code>.
      Can you create an array-object with value <code>null</code> without
      explicitly assigning <code>null</code>? Study the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week10/ArrayNull.java"> solution </a>.
     </li>
     <li> On "length":
      <ol>
       <li> What is the technical reason that one uses <code>a.length</code>
        for an array, but <code>s.length()</code> for a string? </li>
       <li> Could there be an underlying design-reason? </li>
       <li> See
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week10/Length.java"> here </a>
        for some demonstration.
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Creating and using a trivial class:
      <ul>
       <li> Write a class <code>Trivial</code>, which stores two integers (via
        the constructor), and as member functions ("methods") allows to
        compute their sum and to translate the object into a string. </li>
       <li> Write then a program which reads four integers from the
        command-line, creates two objects of type <code>Trivial</code>
        accordingly, and outputs their sums and the objects themselves. </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Trivial.java">
       the Trivial-solution </a>, and here is the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Client.java"> Client </a>.
     </li>
     <li> Study "Charge.java" and "Potential.java", understand how it works,
      and play a bit around (using for example "charges.txt" as input). </li>
     <li> Study <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Libraries/Turtle.java">
       Turtle.java </a> and the application
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/Spiral.java">Spiral.java </a>;
      play a bit around with it, and write your own clients of class Turtle,
      creating some simple turtle-graphics. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Additional exercises:
    <ul>
     <li> More on arrays (and static functions):
      <ol>
       <li> Counting random events:
        <ol>
         <li> Write a program (class) "RandomNumbers" which takes two
          command-line arguments M and N. </li>
         <li> The program then creates N many random integers in the interval
          [1, M], counts how often each of these integers occurs, and then
          prints out the relative frequency for each of these M numbers (that is,
          the quotient "occurrences / N"). </li>
         <li> Your program should work for large N, and thus should not store
          the N random numbers computed. </li>
         <li> For the creation of the random integer write a function
          <code>random(M)</code>, which takes M as parameter, and returns a
          random integer from 1 to M. </li>
         <li> Hint: you need to use an integer-array of size M for performing
          the counting. </li>
        </ol>
        Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/RandomNumbers.java">
         the solution </a>.
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> More on modules (or "libraries"):
      <ol>
       <li> Implement the library class StdStats with (just) the static
        functions "min", "max" and "mean". </li>
       <li> Write a program "Stats" which is called with floating point
        numbers as command-line parameters, and which computes their
        minimum, maximum and average, using your library StdStats. </li>
       <li> For example, "Stats 4 5.2" would yield min=4, max=5.2,
        mean=4.6. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Parsing strings (using methods from the <code>String</code> class)
      <ol>
       <li> Read a string from the command-line and determine how many
        space-separated parts it has.
        <ul>
         <li> Call the class "CountParts", printing out how many parts there
          are. </li>
         <li> In order to input a string containing spaces, you need to use
          single quotation marks, e.g.
          <pre>
> java CountParts 'hhg   j bbnbh bvc c'
5
          </pre>
         </li>
         <li> This task is very easy using the split-method of the String-class;
          see Section 3.1 of the book (also available
          <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/31datatype/"> here </a>).
         </li>
         <li> Examples for the split-functions are
          <a href="http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0438.html"> there
          </a>.
         </li>
         <li> Play around with various inputs (only spaces, leading spaces,
          trailing spaces, ...), to better understand the behaviour. </li>
         <li> Here is a
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/CountParts.java">
           solution </a>
          which also shows the parts with their indices.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li> Modify the solution of the previous part, where now the string is
        split at the symbol "@".
        <ul>
         <li> Again, play around with it (what happens when spaces are used?).
         </li>
         <li> Here is a
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/SplitCharacter.java">
           solution </a>
          which again shows the parts with their indices.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li> Parse a string, where you extract all digits from it, adding them
        up, returning their sum and the original string without these digits:
        <ul>
         <li> For example
          <pre>
> java Crossfoot 'dg08 ha ns82g40h1 '
23
"dg ha nsgh "
          </pre>
         </li>
         <li> To detect whether a character is a digit, use that characters
          are treated as integers, and thus can be compared by "&lt;" etc., and
          can be added/subtracted. </li>
         <li> Here is a
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/Crossfoot.java">
           solution </a>.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Recursion (we didn't do that section from Chapter 2):
      <ol>
       <li> Enter the program "Htree" from the book. </li>
       <li> Write a modified program "Htree2", which asks for confirmation
        before continuing drawing parts of the tree. </li>
       <li> Also print out appropriate messages, so that you can follow in
        detail the recursion. </li>
       <li> Run the program for inputs up to 4, and make sure you understand
        what's going on! </li>
      </ol>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Section3/Htree2.java">
       a solution </a>.
     </li>
    </ul>

  </ul>


  <h2> Coursework </h2>

  <h3> First coursework </h3>

  <ul>
   <li> Deadline for submission is Friday 15/11/2013, 11:00. </li>
   <li> This coursework has to be submitted electronically.
    <ol>
     <li> One Java-files, named "Summing.java", together with
      a file "Comments.txt", have to be put into a directory named with
      just your student-number (e.g., "123456"), and this put into one archive,
      for example "123456.zip", and this archive must be send to me via
      e-mail. </li>
     <li> To emphasise: You send to me, as attachment, <strong>one</strong>
      file, which is a package in some standard format, zip or gzip for
      example, named "123456.zip" or "123456.tar.gzip" for example, and which
      contains one directory (named by your student number, e.g., "123456"),
      and where this directory contains precisely two files (one
      Java-file, one text-file). </li>
     <li> I'll send you an acknowledgement, once I got your package-file. </li>
     <li> To make this safer, it would be good if in your e-mail you could
      state the md5sum-result for your package-file (e.g., "123456.zip"). For
      a Windows-environment see e.g.
      <a href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/"> here </a> for how
      to do this (in a Linux-system, use "md5sum 123456.zip" on a
      command-line).
     </li>
     <li> So the body of the e-mail should look like that (assuming that the
      student number of the submitter is 123456):
      <pre>
Dear Oliver,

attached you find the submission 123456.zip for coursework I, from

  Full Name I, student number (123456), e-mail
If applicable:
  Full Name II, student number, e-mail.

md5-sum of 123456.zip is: 348314edfe76e48ff07ffed81d3e0b23

Best regards

Name I
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> This process has been found considerably more reliable than
      submission via Blackboard. </li>
     <li> Please follow these instructions with precision (this is part of the
      job of a programmer -- to be precise). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> You can work either on your own, or work in pairs:
    <ol>
     <li> Groups with three or more people are not allowed! </li>
     <li> You must not exchange information with other groups on your
      solution. Two different groups must have essentially different
      solutions. </li>
     <li> The marking standard for a pair-submission will be somewhat higher
      than for a single-submission: It is expected for a pair, that the
      program is fully working, and that the details (use of
      <code>final</code>, indentation, variable names) are of better standard.
     </li>
     <li> As a pair you only submit one solution, using the student-number
      of the person who submits it; CC this e-mail to the second student
      involved (and state the names in the body of the e-mail -- see above!).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The file "Comments.text" must start with name and student number
    of the authors (one or two), and can then contain any comments or
    explanations you might want to make.
   </li>
   <li> Good coding quality is paramount:
    <ol>
     <li> You must have tested your code (compiled it and run it).
     </li>
     <li> Syntax errors will result in deductions. </li>
     <li> Of course, false outputs will also result in deductions. </li>
     <li> Use only the Java constructions presented in the lectures.
      <ul>
       <li> Anything else will result in a deduction of 50 percent! (The same
        will hold for the second coursework.) </li>
       <li> This is to make sure that you really concentrate on the essentials,
        and don't copy-and-paste code (which usually contains a lot of noise).
       </li>
       <li> Thus under no circumstances an "import"-statement can be used.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Compared to the book, we introduced the
      <code>final</code>-qualifier, which you are expected to use. </li>
     <li> Take care about precise class- and file-names. </li>
     <li> Choose good variable-names. </li>
     <li> Provide a well-organised indentation. </li>
     <li> There should be no tab-symbols in your file, and no trailing spaces.
     </li>
     <li> There shouldn't be non-ASCII symbols in your files. </li>
     <li> No comments are allowed in the code: write good
      code, so that no comments are needed! </li>
     <li> Finally, follow <strong>precisely</strong> the specification: Not
      just regarding the values of the output, but also regarding the precise
      formatting! </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> See <a href="Debugging.html">Debugging notes</a> for some help on how
    to handle syntax- and runtime-errors. </li>
   <li> Specification of <code>Summing</code>:
    <ol>
     <li> This programs takes input from the command line. </li>
     <li> The first input is K, an integer, followed by an arbitrary number
      a_1, ..., a_N of floating-point numbers. </li>
     <li> If K=0, then N is output. </li>
     <li> If K > 0, then the a_i are grouped in groups of size K, inside
      the groups the numbers are multiplied, and all the products are added,
      yielding the output. </li>
     <li> If K &lt; 0, then the summation sums up the reciprocal values of the
      products. </li>
     <li> In the special case K=1 the output thus is a_1 + ... + a_N. </li>
     <li> In the case K=-1 the output is 1/a_1 + ... + 1/a_N. </li>
     <li> There are two error cases:
      <ol>
       <li> If no command-line argument is given, then error-code 1 is to be
        returned. </li>
       <li> If K &lt; 0, and one of a_i = 0, then error-code 2 is to be returned.
       </li>
       <li> In both cases there must be no output. </li>
       <li> The return-code of a program is set via
        <code>System.exit(code);</code>
       </li>
       <li> Note that the return-code of a program is obtained on the command
        line via <code>echo $?</code>. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> There must never be any other output. Also no additional spaces or
      line breaks are allowed. </li>
     <li> Examples for the case of no errors:

      </pre>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> I assume that most of you start with writing programs for the
    special cases:
    <ol>
     <li> K=0 is easiest. </li>
     <li> K=1 and K=-1 then are the next stages. </li>
     <li> K=2 and K=-2 is already a bit complicated (make sure you can handle
      cases with N=1,3,5, ...). </li>
     <li> Perhaps then you can handle already the general case --- or you
      consider K=3, -3, ... </li>
     <li> I guess you'll have in the development phase additional output. </li>
     <li> However, it is an important task that the final product doesn't
      contain any of that clutter! </li>
     <li> Also no comments (in the final version) --- you must concentrate on
      the code! </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> What if you can't do it?
    <ol>
     <li> Your program should at least compile. </li>
     <li> Some cases you should be able to handle. </li>
     <li> While for cases you can not handle, do not output anything, but
      return an error-code >= 3, which you specify in your Comments.txt.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Some remarks on marking:
    <ol>
     <li> You get 100% if your program is correct (on all the examples above,
      and, of course, also on all other cases), and the code is of good
      quality. </li>
     <li> For obtaining 50%, the program should compile, and should be able to
      handle the cases K=-1,0,+1, with error-codes in the other cases, while
      there is some coding quality (some indentation, some
      <code>final</code>s, names not complete madeness). </li>
     <li> For obtaining 70%, you should furthermore be able to handle K=-2,+2,
      with reasonable coding quality. </li>
     <li> As a guideline how the mark is obtained: 30% for code quality and the
      framework, 70% for what the program achieves (how much of the task, and
      how correct). </li>
     <li> Via excellence in some aspects, some other aspects can be
      compensated. </li>
     <li> Code quality and framework as a guideline gives 5% for each of the
      following:
      <ol>
       <li> compiling without errors </li>
       <li> reading of input </li>
       <li> correct exit codes </li>
       <li> indentation </li>
       <li> use of <code>final</code> </li>
       <li> use of good names (identifiers). </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Regarding the 70% of "program achievement", there are the following
      guidelines:
      <ol>
       <li> 30% is obtained for handling the cases K=-1,0,+1 </li>
       <li> 50% is obtained for handling additionally K=-2,+2 </li>
       <li> full 70% for all K. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> You will obtain a personal e-mail with comments on your program and
    your mark (explained). </li>
   <li> There will be a solution provided. </li>
<!--
   <li> There are also files "TestcasesXXX", which contain on one line the
    command-line parameters, and on the next line the expected output.
   </li>
-->
  </ul>


  <h3> Second coursework </h3>

  <ul>
   <li> Deadline for submission is Friday 13/12/2013, 11:00. </li>
<!--
   <li> This coursework has to be electronically submitted.
    <ol>
     <li> Three Java-files, named "Concatenate.java", "Collatz.java",
      and "CountingChars.java", together with
      a file "Comments.txt" and the file "StdIn.java" (from the book) have to
      be put into a directory named with just your student-number (e.g.,
      "123456"), this put into one archive, for example "123456.zip", and this
      archive must be send to me via e-mail. </li>
     <li> To emphasise: You send to me, as attachment, <strong>one</strong>
      file, which is a package in some standard format, zip or gzip for
      example, named "123456.zip" or "123456.tar.gzip" for example, and which
      contains one directory (named by your student number, e.g., "123456"),
      and where this directory contains again (precisely) five files (four
      Java-files, one text-file). </li>
     <li> Please note that "Comment.txt" is needed in any case. </li>
     <li> I'll send you an acknowledgement, once I got your package-file. </li>
     <li> To make this safer, it would be good if in your e-mail you could
      state the md5sum-result for your package-file (e.g., "123456.zip"). For
      a Windows-environment see e.g.
      <a href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/"> here </a> for how
      to do this (in a Linux-system, use "md5sum 123456.zip" on a
      command-line).
     </li>
     <li> This process has been found considerably more reliable than
      submission via Blackboard. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The file "Comments.text" must start with your name and student number,
    and can then contain any comments or explanations you might want to make.
   </li>
   <li> Good coding quality is paramount:
    <ol>
     <li> You must have tested your code (compiled it and run it).
     </li>
     <li> Syntax errors will result in deductions. </li>
     <li> Of course, false outputs will also result in deductions. </li>
     <li> Use only the Java constructions presented in the lectures.
      <ul>
       <li> Anything else will result in a deduction of 50 percent! (The same
        will hold for the second coursework.) </li>
       <li> This is to make sure that you really concentrate on the essentials,
        and don't copy-and-paste code (which usually contains a lot of noise).
       </li>
       <li> Thus under no circumstances an "import"-statement can be used.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Compared to the book, we introduced a few extensions in the lectures,
      most important the <code>final</code>-qualifier, which you are expected
      to use. </li>
     <li> Also some input checking (as discussed in the lectures) is important.
     </li>
     <li> Take care about precise class- and file-names. </li>
     <li> Choose good variable-names. </li>
     <li> Provide a well-organised indentation. </li>
     <li> For three of the four programs, no comments are allowed: write good
      code, so that no comments are needed! </li>
     <li> Finally, follow <strong>precisely</strong> the specification: Not
      just regarding the values of the output, but also regarding the precise
      formatting! </li>
     <li> Additionally to the first coursework, now also the function-signatures
      (name, parameter-types and return-type) are part of the specification, so
      no deviation is allowed. </li>
     <li> If you use additional function, make them private (they do not belong to
      the published interface). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The programs must not contain any comments (so that you can
    concentrate on the code). </li>
   <li> The three programs
    <ol>
     <li> <code>Concatenate</code>: 20 marks </li>
     <li> <code>Collatz</code>: 40 marks </li>
     <li> <code>CountingChars</code>: 40 marks </li>
    </ol>
    are likely best approached in this order (of increasing difficulty). </li>
   <li> Specification of <code>Concatenate</code>:
    <ol>
     <li> This program concatenates the command-line arguments (as strings),
      in two different versions, and prints these versions out, each on its
      own line. </li>
     <li> Some examples:
      <pre>
> java Concatenate

""
> java Concatenate xyz
xyz
"xyz"
> java Concatenate xyz abc uvw
xyzabcuvw
"xyz abc uvw"
> java Concatenate xyz "asd " " jj" k
xyzasd  jjk
"xyz asd   jj k"
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> We see that the second form of concatenation adds one space inbetween
      the strings from the command-line, and puts the whole into quotation marks.
     </li>
     <li> This functionality is to be achieved via two functions,
      <code>concatenate</code> and <code>concatenate_spaces</code>. </li>
     <li> <code>concatenate</code> takes an array of strings as arguments, and
      returns a string, which is the plain concatenation of the array. </li>
     <li> <code>concatenate_spaces</code> takes an array of strings as arguments,
      and returns a string, which is the concatenation of the array, with a
      single space separating the array-elements. </li>
     <li> Both functions must return a reasonable result under all circumstances.
     </li>
     <li> And the only String-functionality to be used is concatenation of two
      strings. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Specification of <code>Collatz</code>:
    <ol>
     <li> The program <code>Collatz</code> takes an integer n >= 1 as argument,
      computes the Collatz-sequence as specified
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture"> here </a>,
      and prints out the number of steps for the sequence and the maximum
      obtained, separated by a (single) space. </li>
     <li> Some examples:
      <pre>
> java Collatz 1
0 1
> java Collatz 6
8 16
> java Collatz 11
14 52
> java Collatz 27
111 9232
> java Collatz 63728127
949 966616035460
> java Collatz  670617279
986 966616035460
> java Collatz 9780657630
1132 319497287463520
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> As you can see, an appropriate integer type, called INT below, has to
      be used, which is big enough (there is exactly one solution). </li>
     <li> Two error-codes are to be returned
      (using <code>System.exit(code)</code>):
      <pre>
> java Collatz 
ERROR[Collatz]: The argument n is needed.
> echo $?
1
> java Collatz 99999999999999999999999999999999999999
ERROR[Collatz]: n must be an integer from 1 to 9223372036854775807.
kullmann-0:Temp> echo $?
2
> java Collatz 0
ERROR[Collatz]: n must be an integer from 1 to 9223372036854775807.
> echo $?
2
> java Collatz X
ERROR[Collatz]: n must be an integer from 1 to 9223372036854775807.
> echo $?
2
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> You don't need to check for overflow (in principle that would be
      needed, but we haven't practised that). </li>
     <li> 7 functions are to be written (and used, of course, except of
      functions <code>evenp</code> and <code>oddp</code>, where it is
      sensible to use exactly one of them):
      <ol>
       <li> Function <code>parse</code> takes a string as argument and returns
        its INT-value. This function must never throw an exception, but must
        return 0 in case the string doesn't represent an INT. So the construction
       <code>try { ... } catch(Exception e) { ... }</code> must be used. </li>
       <li> Function <code>evenp</code> ("p" for "predicate") takes an INT and
        returns true iff it is even. </li>
       <li> Function <code>oddp</code> ("p" for "predicate") takes an INT and
        returns true iff it is odd. </li>
       <li> Function <code>h</code> takes an INT and returns that number devided
        by two ("h" for "half"). </li>
       <li> Function <code>tpo</code> takes an INT n and returns 3n+1 ("tpo" for
        "triple plus one"). </li>
       <li> Function <code>evaluation</code> takes an INT n, computes the
        Collatz-sequence, and returns an INT-array of length two, with first
        element the number of steps until it reached 1, and the second element the
        maximum number attained in that sequence. </li>
       <li> Finally, function <code>output</code> takes an array of length two
        as obtained from evaluation, and prints it as required above. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> The <code>main</code>-function contains as last line
      <pre>
output(evaluation(n));
      </pre>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Specification of <code>CountingChars</code>:
    <ol>
     <li> This time the command-line arguments are ignored, but input is obtained
      from standard input, using <code>StdIn.java</code>, as provided. </li>
     <li> It reads space-separated words (ignoring all space-characters), and
      prints out the word-count, plus, in numerical order, for all characters
      found the character-representation in quotation marks, the numerical
      code in brackets, and the number of occurrences. </li>
     <li> Some examples:
      <pre>
> java CountingChars
0
> java CountingChars

"b" (98): 2

"龙" (40857): 1
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> You need to use the type <code>char</code>, which can be implicitly
      converted (promoted) to an integer in the range from 0 to 65535. </li>
     <li> The only String-functionality used, besides construction and
      obtaining the length, is the method <code>charAt</code>. </li>
     <li> 5 functions are to be written (and used, of course):
      <ol>
       <li> Function <code>copy_and_double</code> takes an array of strings as
        argument, and returns an array of strings with double as many elements,
        where the first half is a copy of the input-array (copying only the
        string-pointers, not making deep copies). This function must work under
        all circumstances without throwing an exception, except in case the
        array gets too large. Note that unused slots of the array are those
        containing <code>null</code>. </li>
       <li> Function <code>read</code> reads the words from standard input,
         and returns them in a string-array. In order to accommodate arbitrarily
         long input, the function <code>copy_and_double</code> is to be used,
         to enlarge the currently used array if needed. </li>
       <li> Function <code>count_words</code> takes an array of strings as
        argument, and returns the word count. This function must work under
        all circumstances without throwing an exception. </li>
       <li> Function <code>count_chars</code> takes an array of strings as
        argument, and returns an int-array of size 65536, containing for every
        possible char-value its count. This function must work under
        all circumstances without throwing an exception (except in case there
        is not enough memory). </li>
       <li> Function <code>output</code> takes an array of integers as
        argument, and prints them out in the required format. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> The <code>main</code>-function is
      <pre>
  public static void main(final String[] args) {
    final String[] text = read();
    System.out.println(count_words(text));
    output(count_chars(text));
  }
      </pre>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> To give you an indication about the length of the prorams, my
    solution-lengths are: Concatenate.java has 21 lines and 620 characters,
    Collatz.java has 50 lines and 1275 characters, CountingChars.java has 50
    lines and 1545 characters. </li>
  </ul>
