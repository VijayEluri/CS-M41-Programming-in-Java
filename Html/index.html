  <h2> General information </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> First week (1/10/2012 - 5/10/2012):
    <ol>
     <li> One lecture Friday 11:00 - 12:00 in the Robert Recorde room. </li>
     <li> One lab session Friday 12:00 - 13:00 in the Linux lab (room 217).
      <ol>
       <li> This is a short session. </li>
       <li> The task is just to get used to the environment (knowing your
        password, etc.). </li>
       <li> Tasks:
        <ul>
         <li> Check that your login works. </li>
         <li> Access the course home page, and store the link. </li>
         <li> Browse the course home page, and get a bit familiar with it.
         </li>
         <li> Buy the book. </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> From 8/10/2012 to 7/12/2012:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday, 10:00 - 12:00, "support lab" session in the Linux lab
      (room 217). </li>
     <li> Friday, 11:00 - 12:00, lecture in the Robert Recorde room.
     </li>
     <li> Friday 12:00 - 13:00, "exercise lab" session (Linux lab). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the <strong>support lab sessions</strong>:
    <ol>
     <li> In the support lab sessions a mixture of teaching and programming
      practice takes place. </li>
     <li> We might not make use of all support lab sessions. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The role of the <strong>exercise lab sessions</strong>:
    <ol>
     <li> Active participation in all exercise lab session is awarded 10% of
      the overall module marks. </li>
     <li> For each exercise lab sessions tasks are distributed. </li>
     <li> During the exercise lab session, work on these tasks is expected.
     </li>
     <li> "Active participation" means that during the whole lab session
      reasonable work related to the module is performed, typically related
      to the current tasks, but possibly also related to previous tasks,
      or to other questions or problems (of course, related to the module).
     </li>
     <li> There are no tests (or exams) in the labs. Every student present for
      the full time and doing reasonable work gets acknowledged his/her
      active participation. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Assessment:
    <ol>
     <li> 10% is allocated to active participation in the exercise lab
      sessions. </li>
     <li> Two courseworks are handed out, each worth 20%. </li>
     <li> The remaining 50% is the January exam. </li>
     <li> The exam is based on what we did in the lectures, the lab sessions,
      and the coursework. </li>
    </ol>

   <li> Week 2:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday (9/10/2012):
      <ol>
       <li> We write 3 programs together.
        <ol>
         <li> Empty program:
          <pre>
class Empty {
  public static void main(String[] args) {}
}
          </pre>
         </li>
         <li> Hello-World:
          <pre>
class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}
          </pre>
         </li>
         <li> Hello-World with three further names:
          <pre>
class UseArgument {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("Hello, ");
    System.out.print(args[0]);
    System.out.print(", ");
    System.out.print(args[1]);
    System.out.print(", ");
    System.out.print(args[2]);
    System.out.println("!");
  }
 }
          </pre>

       <li> Here <a href="Remarks11.html"> some remarks. </a>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Friday (12/10/2012): Section 1.2
      <a href="Slides/12types-2x2.pdf"> Basic types </a>.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 3:
    <ol>
     <li> Tuesday (16/10/2012):
      <ol>
       <li> First we complete the lecture from last Friday. </li>
       <li> Then we look at the program "IntOps" in detail (
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOps.java">here</a> is
        the code). </li>
       <li> There are many problems with this program, and we try to write a
        "perfect" version of it. </li>
       <li> We learn:
        <ol>
         <li> <code>final</code> for declaring constants: Don't use
          <pre>
    int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
          </pre>
          but
          <pre>
    final int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
          </pre>
          for a variable whose value shouldn't be changed anymore (i.e., we
          have a <strong>constant</strong>).
         </li>
         <li> The <code>length</code>-variable to be used with
          <code>args</code> for finding out how many command-line arguments
          were entered:
          <pre>
args.length
          </pre>
          is an integer, namely the number of command-line arguments.
         </li>
         <li> <code>if</code> for conditional execution: Via
          <pre>
if (args.length &lt;= 1)
  System.err.println("ERROR[IntOpsI]: Two arguments are needed (two numbers).");
else
  ...
          </pre>
          we output an error-message in case we do not have two command-line
          arguments.
         </li>
         <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOpsI.java">Here</a>
          is the improved version. </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> The following material is for more advanced students,
        while if you are new to programming, then leave it for later. </li>
       <li> There are further serious problems with input handling:
        overflow and non-integer input. They can be handled using the
        following constructions.
        <ol>
         <li> <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code> and
          <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> for finding out the range of int's.
         </li>
         <li> <code>try ... catch</code> for error handling via catching
          exceptions. </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> Finally we have problems with the structure of the code: too
        many nested if-then-else make the code messy, and it would be good
        if we had also conditional variable initialisation:
        <ol>
         <li> The <code>System.exit</code> function allows early return with
          an exit-code. </li>
         <li> Conditional expressions allow to have several cases in the
          initialisation of variables. </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section2/IntOpsP.java">Here</a>
        is the fully improved version. </li>
	</ol>

     <li> Tuesday (6/11/2012):
      <ol>
       <li> Completing Section 1.5
        <a href="Slides/15inout-2x2.pdf"> Input and output </a>.
       </li>
       <li> Please enter all programs (still) by hand (no copy-and-paste).
       </li>
       <li> This session completes the part on the basics of programming
        (variables, expressions, basic types, loops, conditions, arrays).
       </li>
       <li> In the remainder of the module we will accelerate the speed. </li>
       <li> First
	<a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">ShowArgs.java</a> is
	a little program helping you to understand the array of strings
	<code>args</code>, and how it gets its value; understand the
	following:
	<pre>
> java ShowArgs jj k ll "  b n " \"
[Ljava.lang.String;@3ce53108
5
0 : "jj"
1 : "k"
2 : "ll"
3 : "  b n "
4 : """
       </pre>
       </li>
       <li> 
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">RandomSeq.java</a>
        is a simple example programs which outputs N (pseudo)random numbers
        to standard output.
       </li>
       <li> 
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">Average.java</a>
        shows how to read an arbitrary stream of numbers from standard
        input and computing their arithmetic mean.
       </li>
       <li> This program is improved over the book version by
        <ul>
         <li> using more expressive code, </li>
         <li> checking for empty inputs, </li>
         <li> handling of input errors, </li>
         <li> and also allowing "arbitrarily" long input sequences (for all
          practical purposes). </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">PlotFilter.java</a> reads
         (all from standard input)
        <ol>
         <li> first four floating-point numbers for min x/y-values and max
          x/y-values, </li>
         <li> and then an arbitrary sequence of points, specified by their
          x,y coordinates (as floating-point numbers), </li>
        </ol>
        drawing each point when read.
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">SinFunction.java</a> plots
         the function sin(4x)+sin(20x) for 0 &lt;= x &lt;= pi.
        <ol>
         <li> Have a look at the error handling, which uses error-code
         constants specified at class-level. </li>
         <li> Note also that the constants "4" and "20" are not hard-coded.
         </li>
         <li> The command-line argument N is the number of points except the
          first point, used to plot the function by connecting them. </li>
         <li> If N is not large enough, then the output can be very misleading.
         </li>

          Understand that aliasing can not occur in the first two examples,
          whatever we do, since the data types used for variable x are
          immutable. And understand why using a "proper class", i.e.,
          an array here, provided the additional level of indirection in the
          third example so that aliasing finally occurs.

  </p>

  <ul>
   <li> Week 2 (12/10/2012):
    <ol>
     <li> The program "UseArgument.java" from the book is needed again ---
      rewrite it <strong>from scratch</strong>, not using notes!
      <ol>
       <li> Recall that it is called with, e.g.,
        <pre>
> java UseArgument XYZ
        </pre>
  and it outputs
  <pre>
Hi, XYZ. How are you?
        </pre>
       </li>
       <li> It's really important that you get the syntax into your fingers.
       </li>
       <li> If you get stuck, then have a <em>tiny</em> little glimpse into
        the book, just to help you to continue. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Do the Exercises from Section 1.1 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/11hello/"> here </a> at the
      bottom, Exercises 1 - 5).
     </li>
     <li> Enter the program
      <pre>
public class LeftAssociative {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    final int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    final int b = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
    System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + a + b); // not what is meant
    System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + (a + b));
    System.out.println(a + b + " + " + "13" + " = " + (a + b + 13)); // understand this
  }
}
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> Play around with it, and understand what it is doing. </li>
     <li> The key is to understand that we have variables of two types,
      <code>int</code> and <code>String</code>, and that automatic conversions
      are performed from <code>int</code> to <code>String</code> if needed.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 3 (19/10/2012):
    <ol>
     <li> Enter the three programs from the lecture (Flip, PowersOfTwo, Sqrt),
      run them with all sorts of different arguments, understand the
      outcome. </li>
     <li> Especially try to <em>crash</em> the programs (missing or
      strange inputs, very large or very small numbers, ...). </li>
     <li> After you did this for some time, consider the exercises from
      Section 1.2 (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/12types/"> here </a>
      after the "Q + A" section, Exercises 1 - 23).
      <ul>
       <li> Exercises 1.2.1 - 1.2.14 are about understanding expressions.
       </li>
       <li> Write little programs which compute the expressions, possibly
        for all inputs (especially in the case of boolean expressions).
       </li>
       <li> If you wish to write a new program, consider 1.2.14 - 1.2.23.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 4 (26/10/2012):
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program which reads two integers and prints them out sorted
      in ascending order. </li>
     <li> Write another program which reads three integers and prints them
      out sorted in ascending order. </li>
     <li> Write better versions of "TenHellos.java" (printing "Hello World!"
      ten times), using first a while-loop and then a for-loop. Which
      is better? </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.3.1 - 1.3.7 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>);
      perhaps first considering exercises 1, 3, 4 (perhaps writing a complete
      program), 6 (again perhaps writing programs to testing your answer)
      and 7. </li>
    </ol>
    See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Week00_Thursday"> here </a>
    for solutions. Additional exercises:
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the sum
      1 + 2 + ... + N. </li>
     <li> Write a program which reads an integer N and computes the product
      1 * 2 * ... * N; choose a suitable data type so that some interesting
      computations can be performed! </li>
     <li> Enter the program "Gambler" from the lecture, and play around with
      it a bit. </li>
     <li> Improve the output of "Gambler":
      <ul>
       <li> Print out the inputs, with additional explanations. </li>
       <li> Print out the frequency wins/T (where T is the number of
        trials). </li>
       <li> Print out the probability stake/goal of winning. </li>
       <li> Print out the expected number of steps (stake)*(goal-stake).
       </li>
       <li> Finally determine the average and the maximum number of steps
        it took to finish a trial (that is, the number of steps until cash
        either is 0 or goal), and print it out. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.3.8 - 1.3.31 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/13flow/"> here</a>). </li>
    </ol>
    See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Week00_Friday"> here </a>
    for solutions.
   </li>
   <li> Week 5 (2/11/2012):
    <ol>
     <li> Write a program "Deck32" (recall "Deck"), which uses only a deck of
      32 cards, where the ranks do not include 2 up to 6. </li>
     <li> Now combine "Deck" and "Deck32" into one program, where via a
      command-line argument it is decided whether 32 or 52 cards are to be
      used. </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.4.1 - 1.4.9 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.4.35 from the book ("Birthday.java", see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/14array/"> here</a>).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 6 (11/11/2011):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 1.5.1 - 1.5.3 from the book (see
        <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/15inout/"> here</a>):
      <ol>
       <li> Write a program that reads in integers (as many as the user
        enters) from standard input and prints out the maximum and minimum
        values. Before entering the program, make a sketch on paper. </li>
       <li> Modify this program by rejecting non-positive entries, asking the
        user to re-enter the input (until he gets it correct). Before
       entering the program, extend the previous sketch. Hint: a while-loop
       is appropriate for testing the input values.</li>
       <li> Read N from the command-line and N floating-point number from
        standard input, and compute their mean value. Create an error message
        if not enough numbers were entered. Compute also the standard
        deviation as the square root of the sum of the squares of the
        differences from these numbers and the average, the whole then divided
        by N-1. Hint: For this computation you could store the numbers in
        an array. </li>
      </ol>
      Always test your programs thoroughly!
     </li>
     <li> Consider exercise 1.5.7 from the book: Read in N from the
      command-line plus N-1 integers from 1 to N from standard input, assuming
      that these numbers are different. Now determine the missing number (from
      the interval 1 .. N). </li>
     <li> As an additional exercise, improve
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">PlotFilter.java</a>
      by not asking for the minimum x/y values, but computing them from
      the input (so the first four special doubles from standard input are not
      needed anymore). Test with
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter1/Section5">USA.txt</a>, where you
      removed the first four numbers.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 7 (18/11/2011):
    <ol>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.1 - 2.1.4 from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> As additional exercises you can consider 2.1.13, 2.1.14 and 2.1.17.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 8 (25/11/2011):
    <ol>
     <li> If you didn't finish the exercises from last week, then please
      finish them now (we are still on functions). </li>
     <li> Consider exercises 2.1.5, 2.1.12, 2.1.18, 2.1.19 and 2.1.20
      from the book (see
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/21function/"> here</a>).
     </li>
     <li> For exercise 2.1.18, if for example the input is the array
      (1,3,7), then the output should be (0,3/7,1). And if the
      input is (-10,-4,-1), then the output should be (0,6/9,1).
     </li>
     <li> Additional exercises on multidimensional arrays:
      <ol>
       <li> Hard-code a 3 x 3 array of integers with the values
        <pre>
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
        </pre>
        and print it out. </li>
       <li> Write a function <code>print_array(A)</code> in a class
        <code>PrintArray</code> which prints out an arbitrary two-dimensional
        array of integers, row-wise. Handle the general case, where every row
        can have a different length. And if null-pointers occur for a row
        , then print "[null]", while if the whole array is null, then print
        "[[null]]" (no exceptions should be thrown). </li>
       <li> Add a main function to class <code>PrintArray</code> which tests
        function <code>print_array(A)</code>. </li>
       <li> Read natural numbers M and N from the command
        line, specifying an M x N array of integers. Then read from standard
        input (using <code>StdIn</code>) row-wise these M*N many integers,
        and store them in an array. Finally print them out, using
        <code>PrintArray.print_array</code>. </li>
      </ol>
      See <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/ArrayExercises">here</a> for
      solutions.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 9 (2/12/2011):
    <ol>
     <li> See the two exercises above for the Tuesday-lecture
     (writing programs <code>AlbersSquares</code> and <code>Grayscale</code>).
     </li>
     <li> Further exercises using the data types "Color" and "Picture" from
      the lecture (see above):
      <ol>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.2 from the book: Write a program that takes from the
        command-line three integers from 0 to 255 (representing red, green
        and blue), and then creates and shows a 256-by-256 picture of that
        colour. </li>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.3 from the book: Modify program "AlbersSquares" to
        take nine command-line arguments, representing now three colours, and
        then draw the 3*2=6 squares showing all the Albers squares with the
        large square in each colour and the small square in each different
        colour. </li>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.6 from the book: Write a program that takes the name
        of a picture file as a command-line input, and creates three images,
        one that contains only the red components, one for green, and one for
        blue. </li>
       <li> Exercise 3.1.4 from the book:
        <ul>
         <li> Write a program that takes the name of a grayscale picture-file
          as a command-line argument, and plots a histogram of the frequency
          of occurrences of each of the 256 grayscale intensities. </li>
         <li> Use the library "StdStats" from Section 2.2 (provided
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Libraries"> here </a>). </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Another (simple) array-exercises:
      <ol>
       <li> Read N from the command-line. </li>
       <li> Create an NxN array A of integers, where the first row contains
        0,1,..., the second row contains 1,2,..., and so on. </li>
       <li> Then add all the numbers on the principal diagonal (that is,
        A[0,0] + A[1,1] + ...), and print out the result. </li>
       <li> You can easily check whether your program works: the result should
        be N*(N-1). </li>
       <li> Use one function for creating the array. </li>
       <li> And use another function for computing the diagonal sum. </li>
      </ol>
      The solution is
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/ArrayExercises/DiagonalSum.java">
       here
      </a>.
     </li>
     <li> Finally we practise using static data members ("static instance
      variables"). Write a class <code>StringExample</code>:
      <ul>
        <li> Containing (static) constants <code>size_a</code> of
        value 4 and array <code>a</code> containing the four strings "AB",
        "XYZ", "EFG", "1234". </li>
        <li> We also have <code>size_b</code> of value 3, and array
         <code>b</code> containing the three strings "M1", "T3", "y6". </li>
       <li> Furthermore we have a static function <code>check_a</code> which
        takes one string argument x, and returns integers from 0 to 3 if the
        string x occurs in array <code>a</code> with that index, while
        otherwise -1 is returned. </li>
       <li> And in the same vein we have <code>check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> Both functions must use a loop for checking the membership in the
        respective array. </li>
       <li> The main programs reads pairs of strings from standard input (as
        long as standard input has not been closed), and prints out the results
        of <code>check_a, check_b</code>. </li>
       <li> For example "EFG T3" results in "2 1", and "X y6" results in
        "-1 2". </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/StringExample.java">
       the solution </a>.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Week 10 (10/12/2010):
    <ol>
     <li> Creating and using a trivial class:
      <ul>
       <li> Write a class <code>Trivial</code>, which stores two integers (via
        the constructor), and as member functions ("methods") allows to
        compute their sum and to translate the object into a string. </li>
       <li> Write then a program which reads four integers from the
        command-line, creates two objects of type <code>Trivial</code>
        accordingly, and outputs their sums and the objects themselves. </li>
      </ul>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Trivial.java">
       the Trivial-solution </a>, and here is the
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Week09/Client.java"> Client </a>.
     </li>
     <li> Study "Charge.java" and "Potential.java", understand how it works,
      and play a bit around (using for example "charges.txt" as input). </li>
     <li> Study <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Libraries/Turtle.java">
       Turtle.java </a> and the application
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section2/Spiral.java">Spiral.java </a>;
      play a bit around with it, and write your own clients of class Turtle,
      creating some simple turtle-graphics. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Additional exercises:
    <ul>
     <li> More on arrays (and static functions):
      <ol>
       <li> Counting random events:
        <ol>
         <li> Write a program (class) "RandomNumbers" which takes two
          command-line arguments M and N. </li>
         <li> The program then creates N many random integers in the interval
          [1, M], counts how often each of these integers occurs, and then
          prints out the relative frequency for each of these M numbers (that is,
          the quotient "occurrences / N"). </li>
         <li> Your program should work for large N, and thus should not store
          the N random numbers computed. </li>
         <li> For the creation of the random integer write a function
          <code>random(M)</code>, which takes M as parameter, and returns a
          random integer from 1 to M. </li>
         <li> Hint: you need to use an integer-array of size M for performing
          the counting. </li>
        </ol>
        Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Week05/RandomNumbers.java">
         the solution </a>.
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> More on modules (or "libraries"):
      <ol>
       <li> Implement the library class StdStats with (just) the static
        functions "min", "max" and "mean". </li>
       <li> Write a program "Stats" which is called with floating point
        numbers as command-line parameters, and which computes their
        minimum, maximum and average, using your library StdStats. </li>
       <li> For example, "Stats 4 5.2" would yield min=4, max=5.2,
        mean=4.6. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Parsing strings (using methods from the <code>String</code> class)
      <ol>
       <li> Read a string from the command-line and determine how many
        space-separated parts it has.
        <ul>
         <li> Call the class "CountParts", printing out how many parts there
          are. </li>
         <li> In order to input a string containing spaces, you need to use
          single quotation marks, e.g.
          <pre>
> java CountParts 'hhg   j bbnbh bvc c'
5
          </pre>
         </li>
         <li> This task is very easy using the split-method of the String-class;
          see Section 3.1 of the book (also available
          <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/31datatype/"> here </a>).
         </li>
         <li> Examples for the split-functions are
          <a href="http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0438.html"> there
          </a>.
         </li>
         <li> Play around with various inputs (only spaces, leading spaces,
          trailing spaces, ...), to better understand the behaviour. </li>
         <li> Here is a
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/CountParts.java">
           solution </a>
          which also shows the parts with their indices.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li> Modify the solution of the previous part, where now the string is
        split at the symbol "@".
        <ul>
         <li> Again, play around with it (what happens when spaces are used?).
         </li>
         <li> Here is a
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/SplitCharacter.java">
           solution </a>
          which again shows the parts with their indices.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li> Parse a string, where you extract all digits from it, adding them
        up, returning their sum and the original string without these digits:
        <ul>
         <li> For example
          <pre>
> java Crossfoot 'dg08 ha ns82g40h1 '
23
"dg ha nsgh "
          </pre>
         </li>
         <li> To detect whether a character is a digit, use that characters
          are treated as integers, and thus can be compared by "&lt;" etc., and
          can be added/subtracted. </li>
         <li> Here is a
          <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter3/Section1/Parsing/Crossfoot.java">
           solution </a>.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Recursion (we didn't do that section from Chapter 2):
      <ol>
       <li> Enter the program "Htree" from the book. </li>
       <li> Write a modified program "Htree2", which asks for confirmation
        before continuing drawing parts of the tree. </li>
       <li> Also print out appropriate messages, so that you can follow in
        detail the recursion. </li>
       <li> Run the program for inputs up to 4, and make sure you understand
        what's going on! </li>
      </ol>
      Here is <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Chapter2/Section3/Htree2.java">
       a solution </a>.

  <h2> Coursework </h2>

  <h3> First coursework </h3>

  <ul>
   <li> Deadline for submission is 15/11/2012, 11:00. </li>
   <li> This coursework has to be electronically submitted.
    <ol>
     <li> Four Java-files, named "Statistics.java", "Duplicate.java",
      "MaxCount.java" and "Plateau.java", together with
      a file "Comments.txt" have to be put into a directory named with
      just your student-number (e.g., "123456"), this put into one archive,
      for example "123456.zip", and this archive must be send to me via
      e-mail. </li>
     <li> To emphasise: You send to me, as attachment, <strong>one</strong>
      file, which is a package in some standard format, zip or gzip for
      example, named "123456.zip" or "123456.tar.gzip" for example, and which
      contains one directory (named by your student number, e.g., "123456"),
      and where this directory contains again (precisely) five files (four
      Java-files, one text-file). </li>
     <li> I'll send you an acknowledgement, once I got your package-file. </li>
     <li> To make this safer, it would be good if in your e-mail you could
      state the md5sum-result for your package-file (e.g., "123456.zip"). For
      a Windows-environment see e.g.
      <a href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/"> here </a> for how
      to do this (in a Linux-system, use "md5sum 123456.zip" on a
      command-line).
     </li>
     <li> This process has been found considerably more reliable than
      submission via Blackboard. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The file "Comments.text" must start with your name and student number,
    and can then contain any comments or explanations you might want to make.
   </li>
   <li> Good coding quality is paramount:
    <ol>
     <li> You must have tested your code (compiled it and run it).
     </li>
     <li> Syntax errors will result in deductions. </li>
     <li> Of course, false outputs will also result in deductions. </li>
     <li> Use only the Java constructions presented in the lectures.
      <ul>
       <li> Anything else will result in a deduction of 50 percent! (The same
        will hold for the second coursework.) </li>
       <li> This is to make sure that you really concentrate on the essentials,
        and don't copy-and-paste code (which usually contains a lot of noise).
       </li>
       <li> Thus under no circumstances an "import"-statement can be used.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Compared to the book, we introduced a few extensions in the lectures,
      most important the <code>final</code>-qualifier, which you are expected
      to use. </li>
     <li> Also some input checking (as discussed in the lectures) is important.
     </li>
     <li> Take care about precise class- and file-names. </li>
     <li> Choose good variable-names. </li>
     <li> Provide a well-organised indentation. </li>
     <li> For three of the four programs, no comments are allowed: write good
      code, so that no comments are needed! </li>
     <li> Finally, follow <strong>precisely</strong> the specification: Not
      just regarding the values of the output, but also regarding the precise
      formatting! </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> See <a href="Debugging.html">Debugging notes</a> for some help on how
    to handle syntax- and runtime-errors. </li>
   <li> The four programs
    <ol>
     <li> <code>Statistics</code>: 20 marks </li>
     <li> <code>Duplicate</code>: 20 marks </li>
     <li> <code>MaxCount</code>: 30 marks </li>
     <li> <code>Plateau</code>: 50 marks </li>
    </ol>
    are likely best approached in this order (of increasing difficulty). </li>
   <li> If you reach more than 100 marks (120 is possible), then the result
    will be capped at 100. </li>
   <li> Specification of <code>Statistics</code>:
    <ol>
     <li> This programs takes a list of floating-point numbers as parameters,
      and prints their count N, their minimum and maximum, their sum, and
      their average, each on a new line, without any further output. </li>
     <li> E.g. (omitting here and in the sequel the <code>java</code>-command):
      <pre>
> Statistics 1.1 4.6 3.1 -4
4
-4.0
4.6
4.799999999999999
1.1999999999999997
> Statistics
0
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> Notice that in case of zero inputs, just the first output, N, is
      printed. </li>
     <li> Of course, the solution must use only elementary means, that is,
      only using conditionals and assignments. </li>
     <li> This program must not contain any comments. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Specification of <code>Duplicate</code>:
    <ol>
     <li> This program takes a list of integers as parameters, and prints out
      "true" in case the list contains a duplicate, and "false" otherwise.
     </li>
     <li> Some examples:
      <pre>
> Duplicate 0 5 7
false
> Duplicate 0 0 1
true
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> This program must not contain any comments. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Specification of <code>MaxCount</code>:
    <ol>
     <li> This program takes a list of intergers as parameters, and prints
      the maximal number of times a number occcurs in that list. </li>
     <li> Some examples:
      <pre>
> MaxCount
0
> MaxCount 3 3 4
2
> MaxCount 1 2 3
1
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> This program must not contain any comments. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Specification of <code>Plateau</code>:
    <ol>
     <li> This program takes a list of integers as parameters, and prints
      the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal values where the
      values of the elements just before and just after this sequence are
      (strictly) smaller (if such elements exist). </li>
     <li> Some examples:
      <pre>
> Plateau
0
> Plateau 1
1
> Plateau 1 1
2
> Plateau 1 1 2
1
> Plateau 1 1 2 2
2
> Plateau 1 1 2 2 3
1
> Plateau 1 1 2 2 0
2
> Plateau 0 1 2 3 2 2 2 2 3 3 2 1 0 -1 -1 0 0 0 -1 4
3
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> This program may contain comments. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> General remark: All programs are rather small. </li>
  </ul>

   <li> You might also add further (private) helper functions. </li>
   <li> You might add new classes if you wish to implement the

     <li> Finally, follow <strong>precisely</strong> the specifications! </li>
    </ol>
   </li>

  </ul>

  <p>
   General overview:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> We implement the game "Tic-tac-toe" (or "Noughts and Crosses");
    see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">
     Wikipedia
    </a>
    for general information. </li>
   <li> Actually, we will consider the generalisation
    "K-IN-A-ROW ON AN M-BY-N BOARD"; see
    <a href="http://www.weijima.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=15">
     here
    </a>
    for background information. </li>
   <li> The main task is just to support two human players playing against
    each other. </li>
   <li> Optional extensions consider some basic techniques for machine-playing.
   </li>
   <li> The decomposition of this task into small tasks (via functions) is
    already given.
    <ol>
     <li> The code below contains all the major functions. </li>
     <li> Open places are marked by "XXX" (to be filled out). </li>
     <li> The given structure has to be followed:
      <ul>
       <li> on the one hand, otherwise the task would be very hard, </li>
       <li> and on the other hand, in almost all professional situations
	also most of the code (and especially the general structure) has
	already been established. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The main program:
    <ol>
     <li> The command-line call is
      <code>GeneralisedTicTacToe K M N hh/hc/ch/cc</code>. </li>
     <li> For example for two humans playing ordinary tic-tac-toe:
      <pre>
> java -ea GeneralisedTicTacToe 3 3 3 hh
      </pre>
      </li>
     <li> Note the option "-ea" here, which enables assertions:
      <ul>
       <li> The given code contains many assertions, and they are enabled with
	this option. </li>
       <li> The assertions spell out (most of) the prerequisites for function
	calls and executions of instructions which might fail. </li>
       <li> In debug-mode these assertions should be enabled. </li>
       <li> While finally, when the program really is used, the assertions are
	not to be activated (since they can require long run-times). </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>  In hh-mode (human-human) your program then reads the moves of the
      two players, handling appropriately (all!) input errors, and determines
      the outcome. </li>

      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> Your output should look rather similar to this one. </li>
     <li> Regarding input, no other input than the coordinates from the
      moves must be used. </li>
     <li> In directory
      <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201112/Two/Testgames/">
       Testgames
      </a>
      some testing examples for
      input are given, and your program must be able to run them
      via for example
      <pre>
cat 3_1_6_1 | java GeneralisedTicTacToe 3 1 6 hh
      </pre>
     </li>
     <li> Note that the first three numbers in the filename are K,M,N, while
      the fourth is the result ("0" is draw, "1" first player wins, "2"
      second player wins). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The tasks:</p>

  <ul>
   <li> All files are to be found
    <a href="CS-M41_Programs/Courseworks/201112/Two/">
     here
    </a>.
   </li>
   <li> You need to study carefully the java-files, in order to gain an
    understanding of the design of this system. </li>
   <li> Marks are distributed on the different tasks (completing the
    classes) as follows (as usual, marks are capped at 100):
    <ol>
     <li> <code>GeneralisedTicTacToe.java</code>: 20 </li>
     <li> <code>Parameters.java</code>: 10 </li>
     <li> <code>Field.java</code>: 20 </li>
     <li> <code>Input.java</code>: 10 </li>
     <li> <code>Rows.java</code>: 30 </li>
     <li> <code>Occurrences.java</code>: 20 </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The above implements only mode "hh" (human against human). For
    providing also computer-playing the following marks can be gained:
    <ol>
     <li> Implementing all four modes, where the computer just chooses
      any correct move: 30 marks. </li>
     <li> If the computer sees always if the player can win immediately:
      additionally 10 marks. </li>
     <li> If the computer prevents if possible a win of the opponent in
      one move: 10 marks. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Your program must never crash! All input errors must be handled,
    and messages issued (before possibly exiting the program). </li>
   <li> Cases which are not handled, must be "handled" by outputting the
    not-implemented-message (already provided). </li>
   <li> Also winnings and losses must be output using the <em>provided</em>
    messages. </li>
   <li> Some remarks on the tasks:
    <ol>
     <li> <code>GeneralisedTicTacToe.java</code>:
      <ul>
       <li> My solution has 22 lines. Likely you need more lines, but beyond
       50 lines I guess there is a chance that you are doing something wrong.
       </li>
       <li> The various cases (first versus second player, interrupt, some
        player wins, or game finishes) need to be organised. </li>
       <li> You need to find out which of the variables are involved here
        and need updating. </li>
       <li> Which of the provided functions are to be used? </li>
       <li> And which of the provided messages are needed? </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> <code>Parameters.java</code>:
      <ul>
       <li> Here the task is to understand input and output. Otherwise it is
        straightforward. </li>
       <li> First XXX: My solution has 13 lines. </li>
       <li> Second XXX: My solution has 8 lines. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> <code>Field.java</code>:
      <ul>
       <li> Read the code! Only in this way do you get a full understanding
        of the whole program. </li>
       <li> First XXX: My solution has 13 lines; likely you need more, but it
        is all straightforward. </li>
       <li> Second XXX: My solution has 12 lines; likely you need more, but
        again it is all straightforward. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> <code>Input.java</code>:
      <ul>
       <li> My solution has 13 lines; I don't think you need more than 30
        lines. </li>
       <li> Understand that it is an endless loop, only terminated by the
        end of standard input or by correct input. </li>
       <li> Of course, you need to use <code>StdIn</code>. </li>
       <li> And use the provided message. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> <code>Rows.java</code>:
      <ul>
       <li> Compute various arrays first by hand, to understand the task. </li>
       <li> Regarding the two examples given in the file-header: The order of
        the rows, and also the order of cells in the rows, is not important.
        All what counts is that you get all rows in some order, and that the
        rows have all their cells (in some order). </li>
       <li> My solution has 50 lines. </li>
       <li> If you have trouble here, first consider the special case
        k=m=n=3 and r=8. </li>
       <li> I think it is easiest to consider the four directions (horizontal,
        vertical, top-left to bottom-right, bottom-left to top-right)
        separately. </li>
       <li> It is all rather simple, it only needs some organised thinking,
        to create a scheme for the creation of the various row-types. </li>
       <li> Use asserts! </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> <code>Occurrences.java</code>:
      <ul>
       <li> If you use a different order of the rows, then your occurrences
	(of cells in rows) will differ from the given example. </li>
       <li> First XXX: depending on how you do it, the one line might become
	two (or even three). </li>
       <li> Second XXX: My solution has 13 lines; you might use more, but it's
	all straightforward. </li>
       <li> Again, read all the code! </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>
