  <h1> Remarks and corrections to Section 1.1 </h1>

  
  <h2> Avoid copy-and-paste! </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> Especially at the beginning (for the first year, say) avoid
    copy-and-paste when writing programs. </li>
   <li> Programming must come (partially) from the sub-consciousness ---
    "let your fingers do the job". </li>
   <li> The errors you make when typing a program are useful for you to
    find and understand. </li>
   <li> Programming is (partially) like chess-playing, you need to see the
    potential movers clearly before your eyes --- but if you are insecure
    about the basic building blocks of programming, then you are strongly
    handicapped --- you can't see clearly your options. </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> Error handling </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> A good program should be able to handle any form of user input! </li>
   <li> So whatever you do, leaving out inputs, giving wrong inputs, etc.,
    never should the program abort, but it should always give you reasonable
    feedback on your specific wrong inputs. </li>
   <li> Like with most introductory textbook, this aspect in handled poorly
    in "Introduction to Programming in Java". </li>
   <li> In the additional programs I handle these aspects of error handling,
    including exception handling. </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> On the importance of functions </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> Functions (also "procedures") are the heart of programming. </li>
   <li> Functions inside a class have the reasonable name <strong>member
     function</strong> (that is, they are special members) in C++. </li>
   <li> This is somewhat hidden with the Java-terminology of "method" ---
    these are just (member) functions! </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> Some explanations for "public" </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> The opposite of "public" is "private". </li>
   <li> These are the two main <em>access specifiers</em>. </li>
   <li> They do not relate to some form of "security". </li>
   <li> But they are about the two levels of organisation of a program:
    <ol>
     <li> To the "outside" we just provide the "public interface", that is,
      what the user really interests. </li>
     <li> While to the "inside" we make accessible also all "private details",
      that is, how the "business really works", not just its "public image".
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>
